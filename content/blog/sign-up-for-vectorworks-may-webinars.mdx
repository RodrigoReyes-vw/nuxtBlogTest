# May Webinars | Now Available On Demand

When talking about the [2023 Vectorworks Design Scholarship](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/apply-for-the-2023-vectorworks-design-scholarship.html), Ashley Scheidel of [Ashley Scheidel Design Studio](https://www.ashleyscheideldesign.com/) encouraged design students to embrace design as "something to live and breath."

You don't have to be a student at a university to be a student of design. Design is a life-long study.

Learn something new by watching an on-demand webinar for your industry below:

#### Iterative design for interior Architecture

_Aired May 16 | Earn 1 AIA LU_

Given the iterative nature of interior architecture, you need a software that gives you the flexibility to explore design options throughout every stage of your project. In this webinar, Kesoon Chance, senior industry specialist — interior architecture, and Luis M. Ruiz, senior architect product specialist, discuss advanced techniques for spatial planning, modeling, visualization, and new approaches to develop your designs.

#### Using Design Tech for Water-Conscious Landscapes

_Aired May 18 | Earn 1 LA CES PDH and 1 APLD CEU_

Designing landscapes with sustainability in mind is no longer a matter of preference but one of meeting jurisdictional requirements.   
  
Site designers can harness the power of design software, online resources, and other digital tools to meet new expectations in water-efficient irrigation and on-site water management. And with the help of GIS integrations, plant databases, and smart 2D/3D object design, creatively managing water in your proposed landscape is easier than ever.

#### COLLABORATIVE THEATRE DESIGN WITH VECTORWORKS

_Aired May 24_

With a request of little-to-no technical equipment in sight and the production taking place in a small venue, transferring Daniel Fish’s version of the classic musical _Oklahoma!_ from Broadway to the West End was never going to be easy. 

Set designer Grace Laubacher led a design team to bring the project to life with 3D modeling and Project Sharing in Vectorworks. 

Watch Laubacher, Fridthjofur Thorsteinsson (associate lighting designer,) Drew Levy (sound designer,) and Josh Thorson (video designer) lead a webinar on how Vectorworks helped create one of the smoothest collaborations the team has ever been through.

# Meet Vectorworks 2020: Clearly Insightful. Simply Powerful.

The wait is over. Vectorworks 2020 is officially here — bringing powerful new features to support every step of your design process. 

“Data and usability are the cornerstones of this year’s product line enhancements,” said Vectorworks CEO Dr. Biplab Sarkar. “When we looked at the future of the industry and what our customers’ needs were, we kept coming back to data. Particularly data-driven insights.” 

“Vectorworks 2020 is centered around providing our customers with intuitive ways to use the powerful tools of our products, while also offering more practical ways to incorporate the use of data for an improved and insightful design workflow,” he continued.

## Simplify Your BIM Workflows

We believe in working well with others — so we’ve enhanced project collaboration at every phase of design. Experience faster collaboration and smoother Open BIM workflows with a new ability to reference IFC files. Say goodbye to a cumbersome, manual process of reimporting IFC files from consultants who make changes. 

## Experience Usability Enhancements

We’ve also continued our commitment to UI/UX improvements to help you work faster and smarter — in as few clicks as possible. With our changes to section viewports, simplify your ability to create high-quality drawings directly from your BIM model. We also added the ability to [directly edit list interfaces](/teaser-tuesday-list-browser-direct-editing?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=launch091019), quickly locate parameters using widget groups, and easily manage changes with a batch rename utility.

Impress your clients with new path-based walkthrough animations, which allow you to transform camera movements into real-time animations or 360° panoramas without interrupting your workflow. 

## Create Unmatched Experiences

Whether you work in lighting, scenic, film, event, or exhibit design, you need a flexible, easy-to-use solution. And with new [Schematic Views](/teaser-tuesday-schematic-views?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=launch091019), detailed seating section controls, DMX patching, and a Video Camera object, you’ll amplify your ability to create unmatched experiences.

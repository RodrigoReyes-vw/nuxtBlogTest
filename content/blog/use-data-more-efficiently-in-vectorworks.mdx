# Vectorworks Tutorial Series | Data-Driven Design

Looking for ways to efficiently use more data in your designs?

Vectorworks’ intuitive, time-efficient data modeling features will help you and your consultants know more about your design through every phase of the project.

This month’s tutorial series will give you tips on data-driven design processes for the architecture, interior architecture, site design, and live event design industries.

## Streamlining Workflows for Data-Driven Documentation

In this first video, you’ll learn how you can spend more time designing and less time documenting by transitioning to a 3D architectural design workflow.

The benefits of 3D design go way beyond improved visualization. Creating a Building Information Model (BIM) will allow you to largely automate your workflow, as BIM objects have built-in data that can be extracted using smart documentation tools.

Click the link below to learn how to automate your design’ssmart documentation tools.

## Data-Driven 3D Modeling for Interiors

A BIM process can also be helpful if you're an interior architect, and this webinar will show you how.

In this presentation — inspired by an elegant retail interiors project located in Tokyo by designers Mana & Takashi Kobayashi, IMA Inc. — you’ll learn how you can use BIM in a more thoughtful and time-sensitive way to design and organize your interiors projects.

## Data Visualization for the Decision-Making Process

If you’re a landscape or site design professional looking to learn how to better use data, this is the webinar for you.

By clicking on the link below, you’ll learn how to leverage Vectorworks’ data-rich tools with visualization data like plant species, trunk diameter, and condition.You’ll also learn how to overlay the root zone of existing trees with the construction impact zone to determine which trees will be impacted, leading to a tree management plan.

## Data-Driven Design for Live Events

Successful live event design isn’t only about the aesthetics of an event, it also requires effective and efficient data management on your end.

Click the link below to learn how you can use Vectorworks Spotlight’s data management and analysis tools to documenttime and budget planning, seating assignments, and all of your live event’s other data.

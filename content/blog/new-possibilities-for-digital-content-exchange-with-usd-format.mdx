# USD Import/Export Gives You Access to Next-Gen Tech from Apple & NVIDIA

Let’s not waste any time. You read the title of this blog, you clicked on it, and you’re ready to learn more about the emerging Universal Scene Description (USD) file format.

#### WHAT’S THE USD FILE FORMAT?

USD is a modern, open-source 3D file format originally developed by Pixar, [and it’s the basis of Apple’s newest reality capture technology](https://www.apple.com/augmented-reality/). It’s also the basis for NVIDIA’s Omniverse platform used for collaborating in a meta-environment.

USD files contain geometry, textures, and support for useful metadata, providing many advantages over other 3D file formats.

According to [_OpenUSD.org_](https://openusd.org/release/usdfaq.html#isn-t-usd-just-another-file-format), USD's unique, primary functionality is to compose "scene description spreads across many files (or other data sources) in many different formats (extensible via user plugins) to present a single hierarchical scenegraph view of the data."

#### HOW DOES USD IMPORTING AND EXPORTING IMPROVE MY DESIGN PROCESSES IN VECTORWORKS?

OK, we’ve reviewed what USD is. Now, let’s get into the fun stuff: how the file format affects your Vectorworks workflows.

Firstly, with the USD import and export, you get more options for collaborating using the 3D file standard. 

There’s also the ability to attach detailed, specific metadata to your file. Storing documentation for different attributes in your file’s metadata lets you export data records attached to your scene objects and IFC data.

###### Connecting to the NVIDIA Omniverse

Another advantage of using USD is the opportunity to harness some of the most exciting 3D technologies in the industry. We’ve already mentioned that Apple’s new AR tech is based on the file format; you can also use USD and Vectorworks to connect to the NVIDIA Omniverse.

The Connector is for Windows customers, and it gives you an open platform for building and operating metaverse applications. Plus, the Omniverse Connector in Vectorworks keeps you at the forefront of next-gen tech by allowing you to streamline your collaborative process and eliminate steps in your importing and exporting process.

#### How to Import USD Files in Vectorworks

Being able to import USD files opens a world of powerful new possibilities for digital content exchange between you and your clients, consultants, or collaborators. To import USD files into Vectorworks, all you need to do is **File > Import > Import USD (3D only)** and select your desired file. From there, the **Import USD Options** dialog contains a range of options to customize your import.

#### How to Export USD Files from Vectorworks

To export your USD files from Vectorworks, select **File > Export > Export USD (3D only)**. From there, select your desired export options and specify the export file name and its destination. 

A folder containing your USD contents is then created in whatever location you specify.

If you don’t see this option in the File menu drop-down under import/export, go to: Tools > Workspaces > Edit Current Workspace and add the menu item from the dialog.

#### WHAT ELSE IS NEW TO VECTORWORKS? (HINT: VECTORWORKS 2023 SERVICE PACK 5 IS HERE!)

That’s right. Service Pack 5 for Vectorworks 2023 is now available for download! To install the service pack, select **Check for Updates** from the Vectorworks menu (Mac) or Help menu (Windows).

The update, actually, contains an improvement to your USD importing process. You can now import USD files into Vectorworks with a drag-and-drop clicking behavior.

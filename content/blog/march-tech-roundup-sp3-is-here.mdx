# March Tech Roundup: SP3 is Here!

This month’s tech roundup is all about our Vectorworks 2019 Service Pack 3! With this release, we’re introducing three new features that greatly improve presentation and visualization capabilities, along with overall workflow between products. Check out what’s new…

## 1\. Experience the Power of Real-time Rendering with Lumion LiveSync

Designers will enjoy a new live-sync rendering connection that allows them to perform real-time rendering while making design changes within our software. The LiveSync plug-in is developed by Lumion and is the first partner plug-in to use a new Vectorworks Graphics Sync (VGS) API, created by yours truly.

Lumion and the LiveSync plug-in are available on the PC, and the plug-in is available immediately for English language users on the [Lumion website](https://support.lumion.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016412674-Download-Lumion-LiveSync-for-Vectorworks). Additional language options will be offered soon.

You can also [sign up](//www3.vectorworks.net/real-time-rendering-with-lumion-livesync-vectorworks-1?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fcontent=sp3031919&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext) for the upcoming webinar with Michael Brightman on April 11 at 2 p.m. ET to learn more.

## 2\. Immerse Clients in Your Design with Linked Panoramas

With SP3, our new Cloud presentation feature allows designers with an active Vectorworks Service Select membership to use our [Cloud Services](https://www.vectorworks.net/cloud-services?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fcontent=sp3031919&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext) to generate presentations of designs with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Presentations include interactive 360 rendered panoramas that can be linked together to create a holistic, immersive experience

## 3\. Discover a Better Way to Work

With the support of our [General Device Type Format (GDTF)](https://www.gdtf-share.com/) co-founders, MA Lighting and Robe lighting, we have also created a file format called My Virtual Rig (MVR). The MVR file format creates a two-way connection between planning, previz, and console systems that implement the support needed for a seamless workflow.

With SP3, we have implemented import and export of MVR in [Vectorworks Spotlight 2019](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/spotlight?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fcontent=sp3031919&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext) and import of MVR into [Vision 2019](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/vision?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fcontent=sp3031919&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext). Now, entertainment designers can create a more efficient and connected workflow between design planning and previz, merging the iterative changes of the model between Spotlight and Vision without re-importing and redefining the performance cues each time.

## 4\. Enjoy Additional Quality and Performance Improvements

SP3 also contains performance improvements, including several fixes to compatibility with [macOS Mojave](https://www.apple.com/macos/mojave/) and significant redraw speed enhancements with Space Objects.

This Service Pack is available as a downloadable updater for all U.S. English-based versions of [Vectorworks 2019](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/2019?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fcontent=sp3031919&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext). To install, select “Check for Updates” from the Vectorworks menu (Mac) or Help menu (Windows).

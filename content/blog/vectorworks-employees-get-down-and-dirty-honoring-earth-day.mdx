# Vectorworks Employees Get Down and Dirty Honoring Earth Day

On Thursday, April 12, 21 Vectorworks employees volunteered during their lunch break to participate in the Howard County 20-minute cleanup.

For the fourth year, volunteers cleaned up waste near our home office neighborhood in Columbia, Maryland to support [Live Green Howard](http://livegreenhoward.com/live/your-community/20minutecleanupandmore/)’s effort for environmental health. Volunteers collected approximately four 55-gallon bags of trash along Riverwood Drive and portions of Old Columbia Road, while also encouraging and inviting local businesses to be active in their own cleanups, too.

Dave Vorel, an employee at one of our neighboring businesses, [Conduent, Inc](https://www.blogs.conduent.com/)., also participated in the cleanup on Shaker Drive and collected five bags of trash, including a snow shovel.

“We're delighted to have more than doubled our number of volunteers since we began participating in this event, and we look forward to continued growth in the coming years,” said Sue Collins, director of communications at Vectorworks. “This event, along with our participation in Adopt-a-Road and Renewal and Remembrance at Arlington National Cemetery, demonstrates Vectorworks' passion for contributing to a healthy environment.”

As a reward during lunchtime, Abby’s Market Café, our local deli, offered 20 percent discounts on sandwiches, wraps, and salads to our volunteers.

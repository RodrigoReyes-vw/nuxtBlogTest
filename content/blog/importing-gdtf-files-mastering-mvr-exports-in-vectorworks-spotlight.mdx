# Import GDTF Files & Tailor MVR Exports to Keep Events Running Smoothly

When putting on a show or live event, you're likely working alongside many different professionals using different kinds of software. Being able to work together efficiently and bypassing convoluted workarounds to transfer files and data is key to a successful production. 

Good news — GDTF and MVR can help you do just that. Take a few minutes to read this blog and learn how you can streamline your approach. 

## Recap: What Are GDTF and MVR?

If you're new to GDTF and MVR, or you're simply looking for a refresher, consider this section a rundown on the file formats unifying the entertainment industry.

GDTF (General Device Type Format) is the ultimate solution to creating a universal combined geometry and information standard for lighting fixtures (with media servers and trusses coming soon). GDTF files provide you and your collaborators with detailed information on how to control a device, what it weighs, and its functionalities, among other things.

Manufacturers can easily upload their GDTF files to [_**GDTF-Share.com**_](https://gdtf-share.com/), where they can be accessed for your Vectorworks designs. 

To create an MVR file, your individual GDTF files are combined with your entire Vectorworks design. This MVR file can then be used to transfer all the relevant information and geometry of your design to a previz app and a control console that uses an on-board visualizer. 

The beauty of MVR is that everything is compactly packaged in one single file, so you won't have to worry about sharing a whole suite of files with other collaborators. Plus, it will keep you from having folders cluttering your workspace. This approach ensures that your production runs smoothly and efficiently.

## Import GDTF Command for Vectorworks Lighting Designs

To speed up your use of GDTF and the rate at which you get your drawings done, download all of your commonly used fixtures from the GDTF site. Doing this will save you time from having to go online and search for these files at the start of each project. Additionally, you'll be able to still access all of your GDTF devices even if you're working at a venue without a stable internet connection.

Once you've downloaded your frequently used devices from the GDTF site, import them using the **Import GDTF** command under File > Import. These files are then saved to your Resource Manager.

We suggest also saving your GDTF files to a [workgroup folder](https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2023/eng/VW2023%5FGuide/Workgroup/Concept%5FWorkgroups%5Fand%5Freferencing.htm?rhsearch=workgroup&rhhlterm=workgroups%20workgroup). This will ensure that your workflow is faster and more organized and you won’t have to search the GDTF site and download your fixtures each time.

## Importing MVR 

For starters, understanding how to use the **Import MVR** dialog is vital. You can use the dialog to control what is imported, not just at the high level of data, geometry, or everything, but also to select specific object types. 

This is especially useful when there's non-GDTF-based geometry, as it makes it far easier to convert the imported MVR mesh objects into solids that are more performance friendly.

## Tailored MVR Exports

Tailoring your MVR exports, on the other hand, will boost your collaboration and file-saving processes. 

It can be helpful to split your design into several MVR files and only include whatever your collaborator may need. For example, if you're using Vision, each MVR will display in the scene graph as a separate layer making it faster to set up features like DMX transforms or to locate specific groups of lights.

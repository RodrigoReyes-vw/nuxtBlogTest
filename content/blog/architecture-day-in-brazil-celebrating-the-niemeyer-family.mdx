# Architecture Day in Brazil: Celebrating the Niemeyer Family

While most countries hold [World Architecture Day](https://www.archdaily.com/904867/when-is-architecture-day) on the first Monday in October, Brazil celebrates on December 15\. Why? Because it’s the birthday of renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer.

Oscar Niemeyer was a prominent modernist architect and the creative mind behind the civic buildings in Brasília, Brazil’s capital city. Known for sleek, curvaceous, organic designs, Niemeyer’s visions made the city a [Unesco World Heritage site](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/445/).

Oscar Niemeyer’s great-grandson, Caique, carries on the family legacy with his own design work. He works as an architect with [Caique Niemeyer Arquitetura e Design](http://caiqueniemeyer.com/), where he follows his great-grandfather’s footsteps by designing sleek, modernist structures.

The Santuário Papa João Paulo II is a charismatic temple designed by Caique Niemeyer and his team. Slated to be built on a 12,000-square-meter lot in Rio de Janeiro, the 1,961-square-meter building will include several visitor attractions, such as a sanctuary, a museum, an auditorium, a shop, a cafeteria, and an underground parking garage.

“This project began with a request asking for a religious temple, and our proposal was so well-accepted that it became the Shrine of St. John Paul II,” said Niemeyer. “My experience with \[my great-grandfather\] the architect Oscar Niemeyer in the conception of so many other cathedrals helped me to create this complex.”

Vectorworks is proud to be a part of this legendary family’s design process. We already can’t wait to celebrate the next Architecture Day — in Brazil and around the world.

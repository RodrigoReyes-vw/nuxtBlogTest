# January Webinars: Data Visualization, Hardscapes, and Scenic Design

Maintain accreditation and earn continuing education credits with Vectorworks’ monthly webinars. Whether you are a beginner or experienced designer, you can gain new skills, fine-tune workflows, and discover all you can do with Vectorworks.

###### Real-time Audit of 3D Models Using Data Visualization

_Aired on Tuesday, January 18_

Do more with your BIM model using data visualization. More and more parameters are needed in a BIM process, so maintaining the quality of the data can be difficult. Learn how to integrate tools like the data manager and data visualization for your quality assurance workflow to help minimize data discrepancies with your 3D models. Join Luc Lefebvre and Sarah Barrett to learn how advanced BIM tools can enhance your workflow, reduce errors, and increase quality output for your 3D models.

This course is approved for one AIA LU.

###### Save Time with Hardscapes and Data Tags

_Aired on Thursday, January 20_

In Vectorworks Landmark, site design professionals will find time-saving features in the enhanced Hardscape tool and new Data Tag tool. In this presentation, see how Hardscape objects, configured as slabs in 3D, now use Slab Styles to more easily specify material layers and their thicknesses as components — enabling the creation of more accurate custom and pre-built worksheets. Attendees will also explore the many new methods of labeling and documentation made possible with Data Tags, a time-saving tool that can be used in your design and viewport.

This course is approved for one LA CES PDH and one APLD CEU.

###### Creating Efficient, Detailed Scenic Designs

_Aired on Thursday, January 27_

When it comes to televised stage productions, no two projects are ever the same, a fact that Grant Van Zevern knows all too well. Join him for a case-study-style webinar to explore his non-traditional process for scenic design. Learn best practices for flexible design with tips on file organization and the benefits of designing in 3D.

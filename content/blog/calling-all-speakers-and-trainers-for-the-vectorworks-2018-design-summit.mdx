# CALLING ALL SPEAKERS AND TRAINERS FOR VECTORWORKS' 2018 DESIGN SUMMIT!

We can’t wait to see you at the fourth annual [Vectorworks Design Summit](http://www.vectorworks.net/design-summit?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&tum%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=callforspeakers02072018) in sunny Arizona! Join us from November 4-6, 2018 — we have opportunities for you to not only learn, but also share inspiration at this year’s Summit.

Do you have efficient workflows that could benefit other designers? Are you a master of Vectorworks software tools and techniques? Would you enjoy complimentary travel, accommodations and event registration? Then submit a proposal to speak or train at the Summit! Applications are now open, but hurry, because the deadline is **February 21.**

_Speakers from the 2017 Design Summit._

Presentations should be one to two hours and cover best practices, efficiency gains, tips, tricks, or techniques that streamline workflows and empower designers to create innovative design solutions. Please note, if you have not spoken at any of our past Design Summits, you must include a short video demonstrating your presentation skills. Applicants who have been selected will be notified by March 9, 2018. 

And even if you don’t apply to become a speaker or trainer, we hope to see you in Arizona at the [Sheraton Grand at Wild Horse Pass](http://www.wildhorsepassresort.com/). Located in the Sonoran Desert, this resort celebrates the Gila River Indian heritage and culture, offering a quiet serenity combined with a high-tech hotel experience. Attendees are encouraged to extend their stay and enjoy everything the resort has to offer, including an 18-hole golf course, horseback riding, a world-class spa, and much more.

“The architecture and landscape in Arizona are very different from the city backdrops we have had in the last three years, and I think our customers will enjoy getting away from the hustle and bustle of their daily lives to enjoy this scenic desert location,” said Nicole Davison, vice president of sales at Vectorworks, who is originally from Tucson. “The weather in November will be beautiful and allow us to network outside and enjoy the mountains, sun and native Arizona landscape.”

# SILV Trains Next Generation of Entertainment Professionals

[The Stagecraft Institute of Las Vegas (SILV)](https://stagecraftinstitute.com/) equips young professionals with the technology and experience needed to succeed in entertainment production.

SILV is an intensive 8-week training program where industry experts contribute their time and resources, their goal to foster another generation of great live entertainment.

Frank Brault, our entertainment product marketing manager, was one of those industry experts. He spent two weeks in Las Vegas this summer teaching [Vectorworks Spotlight](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/spotlight?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=SILV070919) and [Vision](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/vision?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=SILV070919) and said the workload is intense.

SILV fits a college semester’s worth of work into an 8-week program, capped off by a final project where students coordinate an entire production. “You kind of have to put your life on hold,” said Alyssa Glenn, a freelance electrician and SILV student.

For Glenn, SILV’s 6:45 a.m. classes reinforced her love for the classroom. “It’s very fast-paced and chaotic, but you learn a lot in a short period of time,” she said.

“I feel like I’ve been doing class for two years when I’ve only been here for two weeks,” said Vinnie Zampieri, a SILV student who works as a stage manager in Brazil.

Believe it or not, before being introduced to drafting software, Zampieri used Microsoft Paint for lighting projects. Needless to say, he found quite the workflow upgrade in professional-grade programs like Spotlight and Vision.

"I’ve never heard of Vectorworks. It makes me feel like I can do any kind of job,” Zampieri said. Vectorworks helps him to perform quickly the drawings he has to do every day. “I can’t handle AutoCAD. I think Vectorworks is much easier.”

For both, SILV meant hands-on experience working alongside professionals who believe in the future of entertainment production.

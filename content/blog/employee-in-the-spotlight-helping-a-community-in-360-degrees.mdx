# Employee in the Spotlight: Helping a Community in 360 Degrees

Our Vectorworks family is full of amazing people who work hard every day. However, making our software and services great isn’t all they do. Gunther Miller, quality assurance manager, was recently featured in [Howard Magazine](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/howard-magazine/bs-mg-ho-360-ellicott-city-20171009-story.html) (a publication of The Baltimore Sun Media Group) for donating his time to help local businesses that are reopening after severe flood damage.

Old Ellicott City, the downtown area near our headquarters in Maryland, which includes many local, eclectic shops and restaurants, suffered the most damage. Many of these businesses spent months with closed doors as they dealt with the damage. Miller, who lives in the area, came up with a way to help reopening businesses after receiving a 360-degree camera for his birthday.

Using the camera, he shoots 360-degree images of building interiors for business owners who have recently reopened and posts them on his website, [360 Ellicott City](http://www.360ellicottcity.com/). The owner of each shop or restaurant is then free to use the pictures in marketing and on social media platforms. The photos give potential customers an immersive experience to see what it would be like to visit, eat, and shop in these places.

“I’m just a 10-minute walk from the historic area, and consider the business owners of old Ellicott City my neighbors,” Miller says. “Initial recovery efforts were kick started by community donations and volunteer cleanup. I wanted to help my neighbors on some level that was unique and hopefully beneficial.”

# Maximizing Savings & Flexibility with Vectorworks Subscriptions

Design freedom — it’s at your fingertips with Vectorworks.

But that’s not all Vectorworks has to offer. [You also have the freedom to choose between two different subscription options](https://www.vectorworks.net/service-select).

You now have the choice of annual or monthly subscription licenses to use Vectorworks for a multitude of project types. Plus, with a low upfront investment, subscriptions provide an accessible and affordable technology solution.

Both annual and monthly subscription licenses offer the same benefits as a Service Select membership at no additional cost, providing you enhanced benefits and giving a more robust experience while using your Vectorworks license. 

What Vectorworks subscription is right for you — a cost-saving annual subscription or the flexibility of a monthly subscription?

#### Cost-Effective Annual Subscriptions

An annual subscription of a Vectorworks license is the cost-effective way for you to get the most out of all that Vectorworks has to offer. In fact, an annual subscription is equal to the cost of subscribing for 10 months, giving you two “free months” to design each year.

With a Vectorworks annual subscription you’ll have the following:

###### Updates and Support

* 24/7 availability
* Access to new releases
* Priority technical support
* 15% discount on online training
* Auto-renewal options
* Sync renewal dates for multiple licenses

###### Content and Tools

* Unlimited courses on Vectorworks University
* Continuously updated libraries, textures, and more

###### Cloud Services

* Increased storage with Vectorworks Cloud Services
* Generate PDFs from .vwx files
* Generate 3D models from photos
* Publish files from Vectorworks
* Export rendered panoramas and animations from Vectorworks
* Create interactive presentations

#### Flexible Monthly Subscriptions

A flexible, monthly subscription gives you the same benefits when it comes to updates and support, content and tools, as well as Cloud Services.

If your work or team scales up or down, or if you want a low-risk opportunity to see how Vectorworks can unleash your creativity, a monthly subscription is perfect for you.

And if you’re already an annual subscription holder, you can still purchase monthly subscriptions when you need additional licenses over a short period of time.

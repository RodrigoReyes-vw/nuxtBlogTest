# March Webinars: Embodied Carbon, 3D Modeling, and Laser Design

Maintain accreditation and earn continuing education credits with Vectorworks’ monthly webinars. Whether you are a beginner or experienced designer, you can gain new skills, fine-tune workflows, and discover all you can do with Vectorworks.

Understanding Your Project’s Carbon Footprint  

_Aired on March 15_

The Vectorworks Embodied Carbon Calculator provides you with the ability to [assess embodied carbon emissions ](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/calculate-embodied-carbon-with-this-vectorworks-worksheet.html)through a project’s lifecycle. The analysis looks at individual materials, a project’s lifecycle stages, and benchmarks for set targets.

During the webinar, attendees will hear of standards, guidance, and legislation that drive the embodied carbon to the front of the sustainable construction conversation. Stefanovic will demonstrate assessing the carbon footprint of a design with built-in tools that enable regular evaluations during the design process. With the Vectorworks Embodied Carbon Calculator, you’ll have the power to gather metrics and make informed decisions as you look to achieve carbon-reducing targets.

This course is approved for one AIA HSW LU.

###### 3D Modeling for Landscape Analysis

_Aired on March 24_

Learn how to leverage the power of solar, terrain, building, and landscape object modeling to better analyze site conditions, advise clients, and validate design choices. In this webinar with Danilo Maffei, [who's previously written for Planet Vectorworks about site design](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/nows-the-time-to-do-site-analysis-right-with-3d.html), attendees will explore site modeling, the Heliodon tool, and saved views to create useful and compelling reports and exhibits — both for internal use and presentations to clients.

This course is approved for one LA CES HSW PDH and one APLD CEU.

###### Laser Designs | Vectorworks, Vision, & BEYOND

_Aired March 30_

Laser designs are sure to take your live event up to a whole new level. When creating such designs, previsualization is essential in ensuring efficient delivery and safety for attendees and staff members alike.

In this webinar, Lyra Letourneau, creative director for Pangolin Laser Systems, and Jim Woodward, Vectorworks’ senior entertainment product specialist, will provide you with a walkthrough of laser design. Learn best practices when setting up lasers in your Vectorworks design and how to successfully add lasers to your Vision model. Letourneau and Woodward will also discuss efficiently linking your Vision model to Pangolin’s BEYOND control software.

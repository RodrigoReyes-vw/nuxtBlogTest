# Workflow Wednesday: Switching from Rhino to Vectorworks

In [our last Workflow Wednesday post](/workflow-wednesday-switching-from-sketchup-to-vectorworks), we helped to ease your transition from SketchUp to Vectorworks so you could become more efficient. This time, we want to help you switch from Rhino to Vectorworks for more flexibility.

In this tutorial, you will discover similarities between Rhino and Vectorworks. You will also learn how to achieve precise modeling and NURBS modeling by creating an interior space and a massing model. In addition to a tutorial, our resources include a transition guide, a custom workspace, and an exercise file.

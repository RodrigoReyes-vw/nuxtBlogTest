# Vectorworks Hosts Virtual Trade Show Experience

In this time of social distancing, it’s a necessary yet sad reality that most of this year’s trade shows have been canceled. We’ve decided to bring the Vectorworks trade show experience to you virtually, so that you can take advantage of the learning opportunities you would have seen at the in-person events.

![virtual-tradeshow-blog-image-june-17-03](https://blog.vectorworks.net/hs-fs/hubfs/virtual-tradeshow-blog-image-june-17-03.jpg?width=1440&name=virtual-tradeshow-blog-image-june-17-03.jpg)

We put together two shows — one for the architecture industry and one for audio-visual (AV) professionals. Each is packed with exclusive content made to give you the tools you need to be successful with Vectorworks software.

When you sign up for the virtual trade shows — which are free, remember — you’ll get _immediate_ access to the page. There’s no waiting around; you can consume the content on your own time.

###### **Architecture**

The architecture page focuses on the power inherent to [Vectorworks Architect](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/architect?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=061720virtualtradeshows) in taking command of an entire design process.

You’ll find an in-depth presentation on common workflows and capabilities in Architect, plus videos on specifics like data visualization and rendered walkthroughs. You can also check out continuing education on-demand webinars to earn AIA learning units, then capitalize on the page’s special offer.

Plus, we have 6 presentations from partners who make products that integrate into Vectorworks. These special presentations were made specifically for this trade show opportunity, so don’t miss your chance to hear from Lumion, Solibri, Enscape, AutoTURN, Revizto, and dRofus about how their products bolster Vectorworks workflows.

###### **Audio-Visual**

You aren’t alone if you were looking forward to InfoComm, the largest AV trade show in the U.S.

The audio-visual experience in Vectorworks is spearheaded by [ConnectCAD](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/connectcad?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=061720virtualtradeshows), the add-on that allows you to easily lay out signal flows for your events.

On the AV page, you’ll find a number of helpful resources related to empowering ConnectCAD users to put together astounding shows. In addition to helpful resources on [Vectorworks Spotlight](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/spotlight?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=061720virtualtradeshows), there’s also a can’t-miss special offer on the page. We’re particularly excited by a presentation from Conrad Preen, ConnectCAD’s founder, where he talks about the future of the software and its development process.

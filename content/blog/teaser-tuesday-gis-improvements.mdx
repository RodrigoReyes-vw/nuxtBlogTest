Seeing your project in real-world context is a powerful option, and Vectorworks 2020 makes it easy with Geographic Information System (GIS) improvements.

We’ve had GIS capabilities in Vectorworks for a while. In version 2019, the GIS toolset supports a somewhat cumbersome workflow where users have to manually import georeferenced imagery, which could take more time than desired.

Thanks to [Esri’s ArcGIS online capabilities](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/about-arcgis/overview), third party imagery will help keep smaller file sizes without bogging down document performance. The georeference essentially exists as a background image that you can pan and zoom according to your document’s internal origin. You can link everything to the same coordinate system — and for site models, there’s a new option to incorporate geoimages as textures in 3D views.

Along with reworked dialog boxes, these improvements mean that seeing your drawing in real-world context is much quicker, easier, and more accurate.

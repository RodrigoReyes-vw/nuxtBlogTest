# Case Study | PRP, Vectorworks, and the Invictus Games

If you didn’t already know, our [Customer Showcase](https://www.vectorworks.net/customer-showcase) is full of great case studies where you can learn how a variety of design professionals are delivering high-quality projects designed with Vectorworks software.

The story, “A Colossal Undertaking Made Simple Thanks to Vectorworks,” is aptly named; [PRP ](https://prpconnect.com/)balanced new and existing designs to create a captivating experience for an important event. 

Read on to learn more about the case study.

###### Designing an Event for Injured Service Members

In the case study, you’ll read about the tremendous work of PRP, a firm in Vancouver, British Columbia that specializes in designs for high-profile clients. The firm’s design portfolio includes projects like the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2010 Paralympic Winter Games, the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup, and the halftime shows of the CFL Grey Cup. 

PRP’s work on the 2017 Invictus Games showcases the firm’s design pedigree. The event is an international adaptive multi-sport event for wounded or sick active duty and veteran service members.

As you’ll read, the Invictus Games posed multiple challenges for PRP’s 13 team members. For starters, PRP had to work with the existing set to create a new experience, rather than starting from scratch. The firm instead had to adapt and massage their designs to work seamlessly with the pre-existing set. 

With purpose-built tools for design and collaboration, [Vectorworks](https://www.vectorworks.net/) helped PRP overcome such challenges. 

Michael Scriven, a production manager at the time for PRP, said in the case study: “The software’s integration ability is the most useful element, especially in events like this. I can go from doing a layout for the athletes, to a staging layout, to a ramp layout to make sure we're not blocking fire exits. The ability to have everything in one program and then disseminate it to different stakeholders is the most versatile element of the software. And for Invictus Games, it was the best element.”

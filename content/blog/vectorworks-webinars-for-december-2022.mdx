## Better Collaboration with Civil 3D Files

_Aired December 15_ 

As a landscape architect or designer, you can find efficiencies in making use of “background” files from civil and survey engineers. You can apply their proposed work without recreating the base plan. And, with advancements in BIM software, working in different applications is easier than ever before with better file management and staying consistent with origin, georeferencing, and positioning.   
  
Join Tony Kostreski, PLA and senior landscape product specialist, to learn the benefits of importing or referencing files and how imported geometry and data can be transformed into smart hybrid objects. All the methods discussed can provide essential context in your BIM for landscape workflows.

This webinar is also approved for one LA CES PDH and APLD CEU.

Rendering for Everyday Architectural Drawing  
_Tuesday, Mar. 16, 2PM-3PM EDT_

Architects need to produce drawings that are both graphically accurate and full of information, so everyday documentation processes need to be adjusted to meet these requirements while saving time and money. 

Join Wes Gardner, Assoc. AIA, senior product specialist at Vectorworks, Inc., as he details how to not only impress your client, but also accurately communicate your design intent with contractors and project stakeholders.

###### Strategies for Adopting BIM in Landscape Architecture

###### _Thursday Mar. 18, 2PM-3PM EDT_

Landscape architecture firms considering the move from traditional CAD workflows to BIM face a similar dilemma as they did years ago in transitioning to CAD from hand drawing. This presentation will share strategies for your organization to consider when developing a transition plan for BIM implementation. From assessing your firm’s current use of design and modeling software, to meeting BIM collaboration requirements and identifying where support is most needed, we provide a series of questions to ask yourself as you carry out this assessment and determine how to make office-wide changes for BIM integration.

Attendees are eligible for one LA CES PDH and one APLD CEU. ![031521_VECTOROWROKS_landscape-march-2021-webinar](https://blog.vectorworks.net/hs-fs/hubfs/4367-1909-land-october-2019-webinar-copy-design-web-admin-background.jpg?width=770&name=4367-1909-land-october-2019-webinar-copy-design-web-admin-background.jpg)

#### Martin Benesh — Turning a student2PRO Offer into a Career in the Entertainment Industry

You might be asking yourself though, “What does student2PRO look like in action?” Or, “Can I really use a discounted Vectorworks subscription to kickstart a successful career?”

Well, wonder no more. Instead, just look to Martin Benesh!

Benesh is a freelance lighting designer based in New York City. He graduated from the State University of New York at New Paltz in the spring of 2022 with a degree in Theatre Arts Design and Technology.

Benesh, in fact, first downloaded Vectorworks Spotlight in high school to design lighting plots for a school play. “Oh my goodness,” he joked, “those early drawings were such a mess!”

Once in college, Benesh sharpened his Vectorworks skills, taking multiple courses that had a “heavy emphasis” on learning Vectorworks. “Then, once the pandemic started and the theatre department couldn’t put on live performances, it became super important to know how to use Vectorworks,” he said.

The designer notes Vectorworks’ ability to interface with previsualization software as a key advantage for exploring the different properties of light while unable to be in a theatre.

After graduation, Benesh moved to New York City and began doing freelance work. It was then that Benesh decided to purchase a Vectorworks annual subscription through the student2PRO program.

“The file conversion service was super important to my purchase of Vectorworks. During my four years at university, I spent hours and hours working to develop my own symbol library, title blocks, and design workflow for entertainment lighting,” he said.

The designer was able to keep all these resources and has since been putting Vectorworks to work, drafting for TV productions and meeting quick turnaround times. 

Benesh will continue to use Vectoworks as a draftsperson for Saturday Night Live’s “Beast” film unit grip and electric department and drafting for concerts!

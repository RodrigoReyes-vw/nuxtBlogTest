# An Introduction to Passive Design with Vectorworks Architect

Passive design is the use of naturally occurring phenomena like wind and sun to create a living environment that’s comfortable for the occupant. The concept originates with the need to reduce energy costs in response to the 1970s energy crisis. 

Passive design principles are more important than ever given the environmental crises that the [AIA is looking to address with their 2030 Challenge](https://architecture2030.org/2030%5Fchallenges/2030-challenge/).

Practicing passive design can get quite technical, and you’ll see more depth later — for now, let’s look at some of the ways you can incorporate passive design strategies using basic tools in [Vectorworks Architect](http://vectorworks.net/architect)!

###### Passive Design with Everyday Tools

There are plenty of simple things you can be thinking about in the design process to take advantage of wind and sun.

With the [Heliodon](https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2022/eng/VW2022%5FGuide/SolarStudies/Inserting%5Fa%5Fheliodon%5Fobject.htm?rhhlterm=heliodon&rhsearch=heliodon) tool, you can simulate sun travel patterns as they occur in the real world. This lets you plan accordingly for the sun’s natural light and heat.

The Heliodon is geolocated so you can be confident that you’re delivering the best results for the project’s actual location. In fact, a project with sufficient energy use ratings in one location could entirely fail in a different part of the world. You can get an initial view of this by running sun simulations with the Heliodon tool, then analyzing with the built-in Energos module.

Here are a few things to be thinking about as you look to incorporate passive design into your workflows:

* Buildings whose designs have larger east or west facing elevations experience increased solar heat gain and require more mechanical cooling.
* Since heat rises, natural cooling systems allow for the circulation of this warm air up and out of the house so you’re relying less on energy to cool the building.
* Instead of letting rainwater runoff into the local infrastructure, you could add rain swales to the project to collect rain for reuse.
* Retention ponds placed in the right spots can create a cooling effect on the building when there’s a breeze.

OK… there’s a lot you can do that’s considered passive design. But how do you know what you’re doing is effective?

###### Use Space Objects!

[Space objects](https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2022/eng/VW2022%5FGuide/Spaces/Creating%5Fspaces%5Fwith%5Fthe%5FSpace%5Ftool.htm?rhhlterm=spaces%20space&rhsearch=space) in Vectorworks are a 2D or 3D alternative to the traditional practice of laying out shapes or lines to define a room’s borders.

These Space objects use actual space data like square footage and volume, and that information is displayed in the Object Info palette when the Space is selected.

Using Space objects means the space data is factored into the energy analysis. The upshot over designing a space with the Wall tool is that you’re working with a single object that you can resize quickly, rather than having to move multiple walls to define an area. Additionally, Wall objects don’t define area or volume between them, and this data is necessary for accurate Energos calculations.

###### Testing the Model with Energos

Neil Barman, an Architect product specialist at Vectorworks, gathers from some customers that designing with energy awareness is considered overly complicated. He said some even assume a separate specialized software is necessary to track a project’s energy levels.

Thankfully, becoming aware of energy levels for a project in Vectorworks Architect couldn’t be easier! You just have to use Energos, which is already built into the software. Access Energos via the AEC menu.

Consider this scenario:

You insert a Wall object on a structure’s west side, then add a window. You run a check with Energos and it tells you that there’s too much heat coming in from the west. So, you either remove or resize the window or consider some sort of shade to reduce the passive heat gain. You run the check again in Energos and it tells you that your changes are sufficient.

It’s a matter of using Energos to test your design options and using the Energos toolset really is as easy as described above. If you’re unfamiliar with Energos, one of our industry specialists, Luka Stefanovich, gave a wonderful presentation on the application of this tool through various design phases.

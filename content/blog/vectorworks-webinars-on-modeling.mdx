# Vectorworks Tutorial Series | 3D Modeling

This tutorial series is a sure-fire way for you to get quick and easy Vectorworks training. With this series, you’ll learn about a wide variety of Vectorworks features and workflows. Last month, [we discussed ways to improve documentation in your design workflow](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/tutorial-series-documentation.html).

In this post, we’ll discuss 3D models, the possibilities of which are as limitless as your creativity. The training videos will cover the following topics:  
1. 3D modeling from concept to completion.
2. The efficiency of 3D modeling.
3. Visualizing your model.

###### 3D Modeling from Concept to Completion

Modeling can be useful throughout a project’s entire lifecycle, especially at the beginning of the design process.

In this hour-long video, Paul Beaty-Pownall of [BPR Architects](https://www.bprarchitects.com/) will show you how his office uses modeling in [Vectorworks Architect](https://www.vectorworks.net/architect) to inform their _entire_ process.

###### The Efficiency of 3D Modeling

Visualizations are an integral part of landscape designers’ workflows.

The most efficient of these methods? You guessed it: 3D modeling in [Vectorworks Landmark](https://www.vectorworks.net/landmark)!

This webinar — hosted by our very own Tony Kostreski — will help you reduce revision challenges through simple solutions, such as working in a single file through modeling and rendering.

###### **Visualizing Your Model**

You can take modeling and visualization one step further by using 3D prints of your Vectorworks models.

In this webinar, David Farley, a theatre and live event expert, will walk you through how he uses 3D prints with [Vectorworks Spotlight](https://www.vectorworks.net/spotlight). He’ll also share some of his work, including 1:25 lights and full-scale prop and costume elements.

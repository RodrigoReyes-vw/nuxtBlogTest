# Speak with Our Team at the Vectorworks Open House

It makes us proud as a company to incorporate user feedback and requests into our development process. Many of the features you see in [Vectorworks software](https://www.vectorworks.net/) today come straight from the minds of our users.

So, we’re beyond happy to be hosting our first-ever virtual Open House, where Vectorworks users can chat with members of our team about anything from workflows, features, industry trends, or even the pets who’ve been such good co-workers this last year. This is a great opportunity to get your questions answered.

# June Webinars | Now Available On Demand

Are you a designer in the architecture, landscape, or entertainment design industries? Do you want to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in your field?

We're hosting a series of webinars that'll help you take your designs to the next level. These webinars cover embodied carbon, photogrammetry and point capture, a My Chemical Romance tour, and the possibilities of [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/). 

So why wait? Sign up for Vectorworks' upcoming webinars today and start honing your craft like never before.

#### Understanding Your Project’s Carbon Footprint

_Aired June 20 | Approved for 1 AIA HSW LU_

[The Vectorworks Embodied Carbon Calculator (VECC) provides you with the ability to assess embodied carbon emissions through a project’s lifecycle](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/calculate-embodied-carbon-with-this-vectorworks-worksheet.html). The analysis looks at individual materials, a project’s lifecycle stages, and benchmarks for set targets.

During the webinar, you'll hear of standards, guidance, and legislation that drive the embodied carbon to the front of the sustainable construction conversation. Luka Stefanovic, ACIAT, industry specialist, will also demonstrate assessing the carbon footprint of a design with built-in tools that enable regular evaluations during the design process. With the Vectorworks Embodied Carbon Calculator, you’ll have the power to gather metrics and make informeddecisions as you look to achieve carbon-reducing targets.

#### Photogrammetry & Point Clouds with the Nomad App

_Aired June 22_ 

Explore the potential of photogrammetry and point cloud capture for landscape projects using Nomad, a Vectorworks app for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices.  
  
In this webinar, you'll dive into the fundamentals of these technologies, including how they work and what they can achieve. You’ll see how Nomad can act as a companion for capturing site inventory, participate in the design phase, and be used for as-built documentation.   
  
This video will also cover practical tips and best practices for using Nomad to generate 3D models from photos and capture point clouds with the iPhone's internal LiDAR scanner.

#### Modeling Techniques for My Chemical Romance Tour

_Aired June 28_

In a career spanning over 25 years in lighting, set, and production design, A.J. Pen has refined his ability to bring an artist’s vision to life.

In this webinar, the founder and CEO of Penlight, Inc. shares a modeling tip he’s developed using basic 3D polygons and custom textures created with alpha channel transparency. Pen used this technique to bring My Chemical Romance’s “Foundations” tour to life, modeling set pieces to meet a quick turnaround.

#### demystifying bim collaboration

_Aired June 6_ 

Collaborating using a Building Information Model (BIM) can be done in a variety of ways, and there isn’t just one tool or one method available. These varied collaboration workflows depend on the needs of your project and the skill levels of your team members involved. 

One key factor of BIM collaboration is the ability for each team member to use the software of choice that fits their tasks and can offer collaboration opportunities with others. To serve this, flexible design tools and open standards can provide ways to work with others while removing the need to use (or learn) unfamiliar software with limited, rigid workflow options. 

This webinar will demystifies the options for BIM collaboration so you can make an informed decision about the best method for your needs on any given project.

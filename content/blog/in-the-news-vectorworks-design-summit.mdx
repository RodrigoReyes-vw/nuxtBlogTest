**ARCHITECTURE PRESS HITS**

Additionally, AEC technology insights from the CEO keynote, including augmented reality (AR), machine learning, and smart cities, were detailed in [an article published by Architosh](https://architosh.com/2018/11/day-1-highlights-vectorworks-design-summit-and-keynote/).

For more AEC coverage of the CEO Keynote, Engineering.com published the article, “[Vectorworks CEO Explores the Future of BIM](https://www.engineering.com/BIM/ArticleID/17992/Vectorworks-CEO-Explores-the-Future-of-BIM.aspx).” Engineering.com’s coverage of the keynotes continued with the article, “[All of the Architecture Explored with Antoine Predock](https://www.engineering.com/BIM/ArticleID/18005/All-of-Architecture-Explored-with-Antoine-Predock.aspx),” where they recapped the presentation and interview with award-winning architect Antoine Predock and Paul Fehlau, executive senior associate at the office of [Antoine Predock Architect](http://www.predock.com/).

**ENTERTAINMENT PRESS HITS**

The CEO Keynote also included several updates for the entertainment industry, like the [General Device Type Format (GDTF)](https://www.gdtf-share.com/) and My Virtual Rig (MVR), which were further expanded upon in [an article by Live Design](https://www.livedesignonline.com/business-people-news/entertainment-insights-2018-vectorworks-design-summit).

Live Design also published an [interview](https://www.livedesignonline.com/theatre/future-digital-ar-vr-and-visualization-theatre) with James Simpson, lighting visualizer for the [Royal Opera House (ROH)](https://www.roh.org.uk/) in London where they have been creating lighting in Vectorworks and exporting to Vision for the past ten years.

**LANDSCAPE PRESS HITS**

Finally, [Land8’s article](https://land8.com/2018-vectorworks-design-summit-field-report/) truly encapsulated our event with the line, “At the Design Summit you can not only ‘let your geek flag fly,’ you can openly compare strategies on how to use [Vectorworks Landmark](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/landmark?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fcontent=summitcoverage120718&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fcontent=summitcoverage12072018&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext) for a competitive advantage in the marketplace, a valuable and somewhat rare professional opportunity.”

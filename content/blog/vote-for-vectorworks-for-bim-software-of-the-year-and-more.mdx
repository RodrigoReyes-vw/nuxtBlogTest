## Vectorworks Named a Finalist in 2022 Hammer Awards

The Construction Computing Awards, also known as “The Hammers,” historically showcase and reward the technology, tools, and solutions for the effective design, construction, maintenance, and modification of commercial buildings, residential and social housing, and civil engineering projects of all sizes.

The 2022 awards emphasise the importance of maintaining the pace of technological change while reducing carbon emissions, delivering electrification of the transport system, and building smarter cities. 

This year, not only was Vectorworks software nominated, but our Vectorworks Emodied Carbon Calculator (VECC) and a sustainable project designed with Vectorworks were nominated too!

“As the world changes, designers need software that provides them with a straightforward way to get involved in the effort to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change,” said Luka Stefanovic, senior architecture industry specialist at Vectorworks and creator of the VECC. “Sustainability, innovation, and creativity are here to stay in the AEC industry, and Vectorworks is staying at the forefront of these trends.”

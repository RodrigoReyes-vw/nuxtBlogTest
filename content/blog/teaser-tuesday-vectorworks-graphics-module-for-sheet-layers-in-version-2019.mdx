# Teaser Tuesday: Vectorworks Graphics Module for Sheet Layers in Version 2019

Speed is the main event this Teaser Tuesday. In Vectorworks 2019, we’ve updated the Vectorworks Graphics Module for sheet layers.

The update makes user workflows much smoother, as it does away with the delay when zooming and panning through your design. Now, designers are free to move around and zoom in or out of their sheet layers without waiting for the drawing to reload. To see a full side-by-side comparison, check out the video below.

“With 2019, sheet layers finally get the full VGM treatment,” said Tyler E. Littman, principal designer at Sholight Entertainment Design. “Now sheets render and zoom more efficiently, making for a truly improved user experience.”

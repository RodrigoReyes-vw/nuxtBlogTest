## Manipulating 3D Geometry: Editing Solids

In this video, we’ll review editing the history of 3D geometry. Specifically, we’ll review adjusting the base geometry with tools and commands such as Add Solids and adjusting the Vectorworks Preferences for showing other objects while in editing modes. This video is part of a series. Check out the 3D Free-form Modeling guide on our [training page](https://www.vectorworks.net/training/2019/getting-started-guides/3d-free-form-modeling/nurbs-modeling-analysis-tool?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=techroundup022119) to learn more and watch the associated videos.

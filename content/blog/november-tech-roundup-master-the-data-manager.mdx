# November Tech Roundup: Master the Data Manager

Here’s your comprehensive guide to learning the Data Manager feature from [Vectorworks 2020](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/2020?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=novembertechroundup112119).

With this feature, you can simplify your BIM workflows by gathering all your data in one place, so you don’t have to scour menus and drop-downs to find what you need. This all-encompassing management system helps you define data mappings and create data sheets from the same dialog.

The Data Manager provides better access and control of a model’s data output, giving you a consistent way to manage data. It provides you the flexibility to create your own workflow based on your needs, requirements, and processes.

# Unpacking BIM Workflows for Landscape Architecture

The short answer is yes, it can. And it does. The long answer is a bit more involved, but that’s what this blog is for — showing how landscape industries benefit from BIM workflows in similar ways to how the AEC industry does and how you can, too.

## What Is BIM and Where Does It Come From?

The National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) defines building information modeling as “a digital tool that is increasingly helping building industry stakeholders to share highly accurate information throughout a facility or project’s life cycle.”

NIBS continues on the origins of BIM, or why it came to be in the first place: “Effective use of BIM has the potential to eliminate enormous waste in the industry resulting from the re-collection and re-creation of project information and data.”

BIM is all about data and turning modeled geometry into a “single source of truth,” as many describe it. This single source of truth ends up containing all relevant model elements and data that impact your portion of the project. And while consensus says BIM originates in the AEC industry, we’d like to show you how it has the potential to also transform the way we look at landscape projects, too.

Landscape architects are regularly expected to accept the BIM solutions of collaborating architects or structural engineers — it would be a misconception to assume their BIM solutions fit the mold for your practice. Revit, for example, would not meet a landscape architect’s workflow as well as an industry-tailored tool. 

Thus, simply put, the benefits of implementing BIM are tremendous. 

For one, BIM means documentation comes directly from the model. Schedules, reports, and worksheets are all linked to the geometry so that when you make a change in the model, it reflects in documentation. This removes a lot of stress when making changes, because, with BIM, you only need to make the change in one place. The software takes care of the rest for you.

In a BIM process, you’ll have to weigh the insights and opinions not only from collaborators in your office, but from external contractors and consultants, too. It’s more important than ever to capably handle all of their information as well as that of your project team, while at the same time incorporating jurisdictional regulations and environmental context.

BIM will also help involve clients and other stakeholders early on in the process, not later when revisions are more costly and time-consuming. Your 3D model is much easier to interpret by non-specialists than traditional 2D plans, which means clients and stakeholders can engage with your ideas _before_ construction, saving everyone time and money.

It goes beyond the design phases, too. A BIM model is a catalog data used to develop the site, which can be used by those who maintain the site for renovations down the line. 

Don’t just take our word for it! Check out our BIM for landscape page for case studies by landscape professionals who’ve successfully implemented a BIM process and are now reaping the rewards.

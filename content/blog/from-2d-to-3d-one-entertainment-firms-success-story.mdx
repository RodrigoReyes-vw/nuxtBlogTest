# From 2D to 3D: One Entertainment Firm's Success Story

Stagestruck, a full-service entertainment production firm from the UK, were searching for the best 3D solution to meet client needs. Vectorworks Spotlight fit the bill.

After 35 years of operation, the firm knew they needed an all-in-one program that could enhance both internal and external collaboration while streamlining their workflow.

After a thorough vetting process with different software options — such as AutoCAD, Revit, and SketchUp — [Stagestruck](https://stagestruck.com/) agreed [Vectorworks](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/spotlight?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=stagestruck062519) was the best fit due to its entertainment-specific toolsets and 2D to 3D capabilities. By switching to Vectorworks, the firm can now reflect all changes for drawings and models simultaneously while saving time and reducing errors.

Now, not even a year into the transition, Stagestruck has moved completely from AutoCAD and starts all new projects in Vectorworks.

"It shows how easy it is to learn," said Tom Cordory, head of technical project management at the firm. "The fact that we were able to adapt and change so quickly is great for us."

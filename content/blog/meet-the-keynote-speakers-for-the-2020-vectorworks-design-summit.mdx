In addition to his work in the concert and touring sector, Roland has been involved with TV shows like the Eurovision Song Contest, a variety of large-scale special events, as well as a number of corporate and theater productions.

He’s offered multiple lectures around the world, is the author of the book “Show Lighting,” and was nominated for multiple awards internationally, including the Parnelli, TPI, and Top Dog Tour awards.

You can catch his talk, “Design Efficiency in Complex Conditions,” on Friday, April 24 at 9 a.m.

Using examples from his own entertainment design work, Greil will explore how software-assisted collaboration with project stakeholders — creative and drafting departments, installation and construction professionals, project managers, and more — sets the stage for success, no matter the industry.

## The CEO Keynote

Vectorworks CEO Dr. Biplab Sarkar, having presented at every Design Summit since its inception in 2015, will continue the tradition on Thursday, April 23 at 9 a.m.

His talk, “Simplicity to Design the Complex,” will focus on Vectorworks’ strategies to see where the company and products are headed. He’ll speak on partnerships, acquisitions, emerging technologies, and how Vectorworks continues to adapt to an ever-changing world of intelligent design.

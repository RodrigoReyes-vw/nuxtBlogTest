# May Webinars: Sustainability, Remote Work, and GDTF

Looking for opportunities to upskill with Vectorworks? Tune into one of our **FREE** industry webinars this month!

## Architecture Webinar: Energy Modeling in the Early Design Phase

**_Tuesday, May 19 | 2-3 p.m. ET_**

Sustainable design solutions play a huge role in our battle against global warming. Energy-efficient and resilient design is easier with purpose-built design tools that can help you be more efficient and make quicker decisions during early design phases.

In this webinar, attendees will learn how to assess the energy performance of a building at the beginning stages of an integrated design process — this allows you to make informed design decisions, as well as the ability to back those decisions up.

Attend this webinar and you can earn 1 AIA HSW LU! The live airing has passed, but you can still watch on-demand.

# Introducing Vectorworks Community Groups

We’re proud to announce Vectorworks’ new Community Group experience! The free program is now live and ready to ring in the new year!

Vectorworks Community Groups, formally known as User Groups, will allow you to grow with other professionals in the architecture, interior, site, and entertainment design industries. 

## A New Kind of Design Community

Just like the localized, in-person Vectorworks community opportunities of the past, Community Groups will give you the opportunity to meet with fellow design professionals to discuss workflows, network, and share your experiences with [any of the Vectorworks products](https://www.vectorworks.net/products).

But the world is changing, and we want you (and your designs) to be a part of such change. So, Community Group leaders will be hosting at least half of all meetings virtually, modernizining your ability to connect.

Additionally, a Vectorworks professional will be at your disposal for _every single_ Community Group gathering.

Vectorworks Community Groups will be supported by experts in the following ways:

* Host meetings.
* Facilitate conversations.
* Answer technical questions.
* Direct you to a variety of other Vectorworks resources and [training opportunities](https://university.vectorworks.net/).

Vectorworks professionals will also be involved with the remote Community Groups because we’re equally as excited to witness the connections, designs, and ideas that are bound to take place.

## **Eastern and Western United States Community Groups** 

Eastern and Western Community Groups will be available as well!

These United States-based communities are perfect for designers who may not have access to a local Community Group. If you live in the United States, you’ll have the unique ability to grow in your craft and dialogue with other professionals from the comfort of your own hometown. And, even if you’re located outside of the United States, you’re still welcome to join these groups!

Like all other Vectorworks Community Groups, the Eastern and Western United States groups are free to join.

## **Sign Up and Stay Up to Date with Notifications**

Now, there’s nothing left to do but sign up and start looking forward to the great community that you and others will build in the name of great design!

Let’s look back at some of the landscape webinars you may have missed this year.

#### 1\. Net-Zero Water Stormwater Landscapes

![August Webinar LND Blog](https://blog.vectorworks.net/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/220818_August%20Webinar/August%20Webinar%20LND%20Blog.png?width=1440&height=800&name=August%20Webinar%20LND%20Blog.png)

Broadly, this webinar is about managing stormwater to reach net-zero water landscapes. Specifically, you’ll get insight into how to use green infrastructure concepts like rain gardens and green roofs to achieve sustainability goals.

This webinar will help you:

* Learn how to define net-zero water landscapes
* Understand how to use rain gardens along with other green infrastructure concepts to reduce energy-dependent water use on sites
* Understand historical solutions such as water harvesting and cool benches as tools to use on the route to net-zero water usage

You’ll want to watch this webinar to help with your journey into 3D modeling. Landscape designer Danilo Maffei discusses the advantages of site modeling, the Heliodon tool, and saved views to create compelling reports and exhibits, both for internal use and for presentations to clients.

This webinar will help you:

* Use the site model tool to create slope and elevation analysis
* Use the Heliodon tool to create sun and shade studies
* Use the saved views tool to create viewshed studies
* Use 2D polygons, record formats, and worksheets to analyze and report spatial data

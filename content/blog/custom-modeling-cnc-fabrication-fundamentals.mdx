# Custom Modeling & Fabrication with Vectorworks

With [Vectorworks Fundamentals](https://www.vectorworks.net/fundamentals), you have the gift of detailed documentation, precise 3D, and intuitive documentation.

Justin Van Hassel, a Vectorworks CAD content developer, used these gifts to create one of his own: a gavel, block, and box to celebrate his girlfriend’s graduation from Harvard Law School.

Keep on reading to see why Van Hassel chose Vectorworks Fundamentals, as opposed to a combination of other, more generic 3D modeling applications.

Plus, if you’re thinking of making the switch to Vectorworks Fundamentals, there’s a surprise for you at the end of this blog post.

## Uncanny Modeling with Vectorworks Fundamentals

From the onset, Van Hassel knew he wanted to use Vectorworks Fundamentals because it allowed him “to completely layout and texture my design in 3D to make sure all the proportions were correct.”

For the gavel, block, and box, Van Hassel began with simple 2D geometry. This geometry helped Van Hassel determine the size and shape of each object.

Van Hassel even imported external plans and graphics as easy-to-see references.

Once Hassel decided upon his exact dimensions, he started to model the objects, create tool paths, and use custom textures inside the same software.

### 2D Drawing, 3D Modeling

Unlike some other 3D modeling software, Van Hassel was able to switch back and forth between his 2D and 3D views with Vectorworks’ hybrid drawing environment.

So, when using 3D modeling commands like **[Extrude](https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2023/eng/VW2023%5FGuide/Shapes2/Extruding%5Fobjects.htm?rhsearch=extrude&rhhlterm=extruding%20extrude%20extruded)**, **[Sweep](https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2023/eng/VW2023%5FGuide/Shapes2/Sweeping%20objects.htm?rhsearch=sweep&rhhlterm=sweeping%20sweep)**, and **[Subtract Solids](https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2023/eng/VW2023%5FGuide/Shapes2/Subtract%20solids.htm?rhsearch=subtract%20solids&rhhlterm=subtract%20subtracts%20subtracting%20solids%20solid)**, Van Hassel could easily revert back to 2D to review dimensions or tweak his documentation.

### Creating tool paths

Van Hassel also used the 2D geometry of his objects to create custom tool paths, prepping for his CNC machine.

“The benefits of the tool paths were the accuracy that I can get from using a CNC. The process was very easy because I just used the import image command to bring in the Harvard logo and, after scaling, I could use the polyline tool to trace over the image file,” he said.

Van Hassel noted that this process was one of the most intuitive and important parts of his entire project.

### Custom Renderworks Textures 

After creating all the 3D models and 2D tool paths, Van Hassel experimented with Renderworks textures, found directly in Fundamentals.

Using walnut, maple, and ebony textures like he would in real life helped Van Hassel visualize his creation in great detail.

## Painless Fabrication Processes

The next step for Van Hassel and Vectorworks Fundamentals alike was to send the designs off to his CNC machine.

With Fundamentals, Van Hassel had no need to use a separate application to clean up his file. He instead used an Export to SVG plugin and shipped the designs directly to his CNC machine.

Van Hassel chose to use an SVG file because his machine could take the file at full scale, and there was no need to rescale any part of the project. “I was able to start cutting within five minutes of export,” he added.

The different objects also could’ve been sent to the machine from Fundamentals in other formats, such as DWG or STL.

The result of the final fabrication is so impressive that we’re just going to let the final photos speak for themselves:

When you think about the sustainability of buildings, you may tend to think first of the big topics of energy, water, materials, and air. These factors are of course linked to the creation of environmentally friendly buildings.  
  
But there‚Äôs more to be discussed when it comes to sustainable architecture. Site conditions, location, density, transit, and more can all have a huge impact on a project.

Many of these principles are measured by all the major green building rating systems around the world, which include LEED, [BREEAM](https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/An%5Fintroduction%5Fto%5FBREEAM), and [Greenstar](https://new.gbca.org.au/green-star/exploring-green-star/), which dominate the US, UK, and Australian markets respectively. While they might vary in terms of scope, measurement, and proof of performance, their similarities are guided by core principles. In this article, we‚Äôll concentrate on LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design).  
  
For a project to achieve its highest LEED score, it needs to have been strategized to advance environmental welfare. There are several factors in this area measured by LEED that we‚Äôll discuss in this blog post.

## **SITE CONDITIONS & PROJECT LOCATION**

### **NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT LOCATION**

In this category there are three major items considered by LEED:

* Avoiding development on inappropriate sites
* Reducing vehicle distance traveled
* Enhancing livability and improving human health by encouraging daily physical activity

Achieving these goals means you‚Äôre developing on a site that is near local amenities such as restaurants or shopping centers. Being located near public parks or trails encourages the ‚Äúdaily physical activity‚Äù mentioned by LEED.

### **BROWNFIELD SITES & ADAPTIVE REUSE**

Avoiding sensitive land ‚Äî such as prime farmland, floodplains, special habitats, water bodies, and wetlands ‚Äî is a critical factor to recognize when deciding on the location of a building. Often, this can be done by taking advantage of previously developed land.

[Redeveloping a brownfield](https://www.epa.gov/brownfields/overview-epas-brownfields-program) is a highly sustainable practice that falls into this category. [Adaptive reuse](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/adaptive-reuse-architecture-guide), or recycling buildings or sites for different purposes than the original, is similarly advantageous.

## **DIVERSE USES, EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT, & DENSITY**

### **HIGH-PRIORITY SITE AND EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT**

The main goals of this category are to encourage uplifting the ‚Äúeconomic and social vitality of communities,‚Äù and to ‚Äúencourage project location in areas with development constraints and promote the ecological and community health of the surrounding area."

So, as an example, locating a new community center in a disadvantaged area can increase the project‚Äôs LEED score. [LEED outlines what ‚Äúdisadvantaged area‚Äù means here](https://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/2021-03/LEED%20v4.1%20BDC%20200110%5Ftracked.pdf).

### **SURROUNDING DENSITY AND DIVERSE USES**

Building near existing infrastructure is preferred to building away from it. LEED outlines precise distances and density metrics to reference.

A project can score points for having proximity to other buildings with separate public uses. If you‚Äôre building a retail store, you can score points for being located within half a mile (800 meters) of restaurants, other retail shops, public schools, etc.

## **TRANSIT & REDUCED VEHICLE FOOTPRINT**

### **ACCESS TO QUALITY TRANSIT**

Access to reliable public transit reduces the need for people to drive their own cars, and cars are a [big contributor to worldwide greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions).

### **BICYCLE FACILITIES**

Continuing with the theme, accommodating bicycles is another way to up the sustainability level of a building. Encouraging commuters to bicycle to the building instead of drive reduces carbon emissions from transportation associated with the project.

‚ÄúFacilities‚Äù refers to accommodations such racks for storage and shower rooms. In addition to reducing transportation emissions, including these items in a project contributes to a reduced parking footprint.

### **REDUCED PARKING FOOTPRINT**

Dense areas are likely to have heavier parking needs. Parking facilities are environmentally harmful due to ‚Äúautomobile dependence, land consumption, and rainwater runoff.‚Äù

There are a variety of ways to reduce a project‚Äôs associated parking footprint, including:

* Not providing off-street parking
* Providing dedicated parking for carshare vehicles
* Selling parking separately from property sales or leases

### **ELECTRIC VEHICLES**

Electric vehicles are more environmentally friendly because they emit less greenhouse gas. You can encourage electric vehicle use by making sure to include at least one charging station in the design of your project. This can have a positive effect on the project‚Äôs LEED score.

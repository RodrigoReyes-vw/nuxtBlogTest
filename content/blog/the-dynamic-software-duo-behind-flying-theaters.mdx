# The Dynamic Software Duo Behind Flying Theaters

[connectCAD](https://connectcad.com/) sat down for an interview with Hannes Reisinger, AV systems engineer for [Kraftwerk Living Technologies](http://www.kraftwerk.at/). Headquartered in Wels, Austria, Kraftwerk Living Technologies is one of the leading companies in the field of professional audio-visual system integration. The company uses [Vectorworks](http://www.vectorworks.net/?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=connectcad060118) with connectCAD to design its audiovisual projects, and Hannes shared why he has chosen this combination of software. Here are his remarks.

_connectCAD for Vectorworks is used for the majority of our projects. We’re not only using it for Simple Line Diagrams and Rack Layouts, but \[we\] also extensively rely on its database functionality._ _For example, in one of our recent projects, the Voletarium Flying Theater at Europa-Park in Germany, there’s one very specialized and handy workflow we used during the design process: The Voletarium consists of two identical Flying Theaters. After designing the first one, we used the Search-And-Replace function over the Device Report, so the process of designing the second one was simplified quite substantially. Overall, connectCAD’s handy tools allow us to adapt parts when attractions are similar and leave us with enough flexibility for designing projects and attraction-specific details and requirements._

_Before choosing to switch to connectCAD, we had been on the lookout for quite a while. Our key factors for choosing were:_

* _Flexibility and speed_
* _Customizability: From a functional, as well as aesthetic point of view_
* _Cross-platform and cross-language without limitations_

_Thanks to connectCAD, our schematics have become the hub of information for every project. This should be a no-brainer, but we keep seeing it left out by the competition: Inside our racks and assemblies, every single cable is labelled. From either side, you can tell where to plug it in, and where it’s coming from. Thanks to a connectCAD Cable Report and a handy Excel file, this is an easy streamlined process._

_We use a “Master Tracking List” that helps us keep track of serial numbers, address information and implementation progress. The basis for this list is a connectCAD Device Report._

_The database option that connectCAD provides is the basis of all our “following” workflows, either internal cable lists, our master technical equipment list, even the device ID stickers are generated out of connectCAD._

_We are working in an industry that is in constant change — the availability of new technology might mean a last-minute change to core components of a system. At the same time, tight schedules always demand a very quick output; when there’s a lot at risk already, the plans can’t be another bottleneck. connectCAD has proven to be a tool fit for the job._

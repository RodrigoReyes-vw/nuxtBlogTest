# February Webinars: Renderings and Open BIM

Maintain accreditation and earn continuing education credits with Vectorworks’ monthly webinars. Whether you’re a beginner or experienced designer, you can gain new skills, fine-tune workflows, and discover all you can do with Vectorworks. 

## Rendering for Everyday Architectural Drawings 

_Aired on Tuesday, February 15_

Architects need to produce drawings that are graphically accurate and full of information, meaning everyday documentation processes need to be adjusted to meet these requirements. 

In this presentation, you’ll learn how rendering tools and feature sets can be used to enhance the graphic quality of your designs. Impress your clients and accurately communicate your design intent with contractors and project stakeholders, too. Attendees will explore these rendering best practices through sample workflows that showcase cutting-edge technologies in the architecture industry.

This course is approved for one AIA LU, AIBC, AAA, ALBNL, AANB, and NSAA.

## Open BIM and IFC for Landscape Architecture

_Aired on Thursday, February 17_

BIM for today’s landscape design industry is possible thanks to the use of powerful software. 

In Norway, policies have come a long way in ensuring IFC standards. In this presentation with Åge Langedrag of Multiconsult, you’ll learn how BIM for landscape has evolved and shaped our way of site design for the last 15+ years. The BIM specialist and landscape architect will also discuss the standardization of Open BIM and IFC for landscape while evaluating design software’s place in current workflows.

This course is approved for one LA CES PDH and one APLD CEU.

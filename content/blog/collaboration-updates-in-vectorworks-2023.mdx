Watch as Senior Product Specialist Sarah Barrett tells you about improved collaboration with Revit files and improved BIM issue management, then read on for more information on upcoming interoperability features.

## Improved Collaboration with Revit Files

You and your consultants will have more control over a project with the help of amore streamlined Revit import referencing processes in Vectorworks 2023.

These improvements will let you be more flexible when using files created in Revit — whether it’s to support a collaboration and refenced workflow, or to import directly into your Vectorworks application.

## Customizable DWG Import and Export Options

You’ll find an ease-of-use while collaborating via DWG/DXF files in Vectorworks 2023 by being able to control which layers you’re importing and/or exporting. This kind of precision during the file management and sharing process will speed up and simplify the process of collaborating with consultants who use various Autodesk products.

## IFC Import Improvements

There are also some powerful enhancements coming to the importing process of IFC files.

You’ll experience more effective collaboration with the ability to import from more applications. Also, you’ll have more control of your imported IFC files with new options to filter objects by, class, story, and criteria-based mapping.

All these IFC enhancements will help you [adopt an OpenBIM workflow](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/4-keys-to-successful-data-modeling-implementation.html), if you haven’t yet already.

## Improved BIM Issue Management

The BCF Manager is now a web palette that can be kept open, so you can seamlessly manage model changes with cloud-based collaboration tools like BIMCollab, BIMSync, and more.

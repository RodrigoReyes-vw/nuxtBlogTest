# 3 Wins: Starting Strong with 2019 Awards

Not to brag, but it’s only two months into 2019, and we have already won four awards! 

After claiming a victory in the [Land8 Social Media Awards for Landscape Architecture](/land8-award-endorses-vectorworks-as-social-media-savvy?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=awards022819) earlier this year, we were announced as the winner of two awards from [BUILD Magazine](https://www.build-review.com/): their 2019 Design & Build Awards’ “One to Watch in 2019” and “Best BIM Software Developer 2019 – Metro Washington D.C.” in the Home & Garden Awards. Plus, we were crowned as the “Leading Providers of BIM & CAD Design Software 2019” in the [2019 Designer Awards](https://www.lux-review.com/lux%5Fawards/designer-awards/), hosted by [LUX-Life](https://www.lux-review.com/lux%5Fawards/designer-awards/) Magazine.

The BUILD Awards are dedicated to uncovering and rewarding the very best in technical innovation, design, and service. This program showcases companies around the world that are innovating, trailblazing, and deserving of recognition.

“Here at BUILD, we noticed that Vectorworks had a fantastic 2018, and we believe they will go on to do great things in 2019,” said Megan Cashmore, features executive at BUILD Magazine. “With the release of their 2019 software, we have seen a huge increase in efficiency and innovation for designers within the industry. Their success has led them to be selected as a One to Watch in 2019.”

Not only are we “Ones to Watch” in the eyes of BUILD, but also “Best BIM Software Developer 2019 – Metro Washington D.C.” in their 2019 Home & Garden Awards. From creative minds in landscaping and interior design, to cleaners and carpenters, this award is designed to highlight companies supporting professionals to truly make a house a home.

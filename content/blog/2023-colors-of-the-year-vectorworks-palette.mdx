## A Return to Nature … With People in Mind

As you can tell from the paint manufacturers' statements, nearly all of the colors have two things in common: nature and you.

Whether the color is meant to energize, inspire, or relax you, they all seam to be influenced by the natural world and have [the well-being of people in mind](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/sustainable-design-for-interiors-projects-using-time-saving-tools.html).

Such a focus is finally getting the attention it deserves in the design world, and we couldn't be more excited.

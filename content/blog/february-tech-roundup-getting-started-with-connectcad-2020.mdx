# February Tech Roundup: Getting Started with ConnectCAD 2020

It’s been a few months since [we launched ](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/connectcad?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=022020febtechroundup)[ConnectCAD 2020](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/connectcad?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=022020febtechroundup), the signal flow add-on for [Spotlight](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/spotlight?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=022020febtechroundup) and [Designer](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/designer?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=022020febtechroundup) that allows AV professionals to lay out signal flows in an easy-to-read format. If you’re looking for some help with the new addition, here are some courses to get you started.

## Getting Started

This step-by-step course gives you the basics for creating schematic diagrams in ConnectCAD, specifically how to create devices and make connections between them.

In this course, explore one of ConnectCAD’s most important workflows that allows you to repeat patterns to speed up drawings — Duplicate-Modify, which you can use on devices and circuits, too.

Duplicate-Modify helps you think of design in terms of factoring out patterns and modularizing your system, all of which are beneficial not just to your drawing but also to the integrity of the system itself.

## Visualizing Connector Panels

The launch of ConnectCAD also introduced changes to better visualize custom connector panels. This function has been integrated into the Equipment Item object so that your custom panels will appear in equipment reports.

Now, you’re able to add graphics to equipment front panels, so you can easily do connector panels in the same way.

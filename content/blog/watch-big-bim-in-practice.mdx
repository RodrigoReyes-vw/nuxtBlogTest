# WATCH: Big BIM in Practice

Building Information Modeling (BIM) allows architects to manage large projects more efficiently than ever before. See how in these three case study videos.

###### [3 + 1 Architects](http://www.threeplusone.ee/)

3 + 1 Architects follows “strict standards” in Estonia about open information requirements in public buildings. They meet these requirements with [Vectorworks Architect](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/architect?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=BIGBIM080119)’s BIM capabilities to uphold all their information for projects they admit are “so big and complicated that you couldn’t control them without BIM.”

###### [IttenBrechbühl](https://www.ittenbrechbuehl.ch/en/node/6324)

This firm designed the Scott Headquarters in Givisiez, an incredible merge of modernity and practicality that speaks to IttenBrechbühl’s understanding of their clients’ needs**.** They believe that BIM as a collaboration model will become as widely implemented as CAD drafting. In their own words, “BIM planning strengthens the role of the architect by allowing for stronger coordination, stronger process control, and the ability to pull all the pieces of the project together.”

###### [King + King Architects](https://kingarch.com/)

King + King Architects is the third-oldest practicing architectural firm in the United States. They’ve designed monuments like the Crouse College at Syracuse University, a towering visage which looks almost gothic, and they’re constantly looking for new ways to incorporate architectural technology into their workflows — BIM, therefore, came naturally. 

“We as architects are continually taking on more and more complexity,” said Matt Flynn, design manager at King + King. “BIM is something that allows us to manage that easier.”

# Vectorworks Tutorial Series | Documentation

This tutorial series is a sure-fire way for you to get quick and easy Vectorworks training. With this series, you’ll learn about a wide variety of Vectorworks features and workflows. Last month, [we shared training videos on visualization features available in Vectorworks](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/vectorworks-tutorial-series-visualization.html).

In this post, we’ll be discussing documentation, a cornerstone of any design and BIM (Building Information Modeling) workflow. The three videos in today’s tutorial series will teach the following: 
1. Clear design documentation for lighting design.
2. Better documentation with custom design elements.
3. Save time with documentation.

###### Clear Design Documentation for Lighting Design 

In the age of COVID-19, face-to-face meetings are few and far between; so, clear documentation is crucial when communicating with other departments. Luckily, Vectorworks Spotlight and ConnectCAD give you concise networking and data layouts for lighting design.

This video features [Naked Eye Ltd.'s](https://www.nakedeyelighting.com/) Max Conwell, designer of ITV’s game show _The Void_. Check out the video, and Conwell will teach you the about paperwork, data layouts, and more!

###### Better Documentation with Custom Design Elements

Custom geometry will not only give your design a more unique visualization, but they will also allow for better drawings. This webinar, featuring a stunning home theatre, will show you the useful ways BIM can be used in your interior designs.

Additionally, this one-hour webinar will cover is how you can take advantage of your 3D model for [communicating design intent to a client](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/communicate-inspiration-interiors-vectorworks.html).

###### Save Time When Documenting

Whether you’re an established design professional or a student yet to begin their journey into the profession, you’ve likely heard the age-old saying: “Time is money.” But how do you save time when you’re designing? One great way is by harvesting data from model geometry to create cost estimates and custom reports.

Although this webinar is presented through the lens of site design, labeling and documentation with Data Tags will save you time, regardless of your industry!

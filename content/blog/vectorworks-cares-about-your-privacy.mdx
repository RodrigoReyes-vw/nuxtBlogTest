We’ve all seen the recent news stories about privacy and the use of personal data. Have you been wondering how the companies you do business with are handling these issues?

At Vectorworks, we’d like to put your mind at ease. We are committed to protecting your privacy and keeping you in control of your data. We don’t collect extraneous personal data or process it in unexpected ways.

Our motivation for collecting personal data from you, whether you are a current customer or are considering purchasing our products, has always been very simple. We need to understand you well enough that we can assist you in buying and using Vectorworks, as well as improve Vectorworks to meet your future needs.

In addressing the requirements of the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we have carefully reviewed all our systems and processes to ensure that you can easily understand what data we collect and why. You can see the results of this in the new, more-accessible privacy information section of our website. What you cannot see is the behind-the-scenes effort we have made across the company to ensure our staff and systems are all using the best available processes to keep your personal data secure.

With that in mind, here are some of the key changes we’ve recently made at Vectorworks to continue to best serve you and protect your data. 

* **Privacy and Cookie updates**  
The upcoming GDPR places new obligations on organizations that process EU personal data. As a result, we’ve updated our [privacy statement](http://www.vectorworks.net/legal/privacy-statement) to better explain our relationship with customers. In addition, we've added a [cookie statement](http://www.vectorworks.net/legal/cookie-statement) and cookie acceptance banner on [our website](http://www.vectorworks.net/) so you can more clearly understand our use of website cookies and your options to accept or decline them.
* **Consent checkboxes on our forms**  
From time to time, you might interact with us to register for a webinar, request a trial license, request support, etc. When you complete a form related to a Vectorworks event, product, or service, you’ll soon see a consent statement to acknowledge that you may be contacted in the future. You also have the option to adjust your contact preferences if you change your mind.
* **Changes to Vectorworks software preferences**  
To assist us with improving our software, Vectorworks collects certain application-related data in the form of error reporting. When you share information with us, we can better serve you and meet your needs. However, you control the type of data that we receive. Going forward, you will be asked to specify the reporting level at installation. Later, you can manage your application error reporting preference at any time by going to _Vectorworks Preferences_ and clicking the _Session_ tab.

We encourage you to review the new privacy and cookie statements and familiarize yourself with these changes. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at [privacy@vectorworks.net](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/index.html).

We also encourage you to visit our privacy page at any time to stay up to date on the latest ways we are keeping your data secure.

**Point Cloud Enhancement Video**

Reality capture has quickly transformed from a high-cost, advanced technology for experts into an affordable and accessible process that can have a major impact on your design workflow. Our latest release makes working with point clouds faster and easier. The new [Merge Point Clouds command](http://app-help.vectorworks.net/2019/eng/VW2019%5FGuide/Objects%5Fedit2/Merging%5FPoint%5FClouds.htm?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=button&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=techroundup012419) creates a single model from individual scans, and a new custom color option allows you to define height limits of various regions, so you can better visualize your data set.

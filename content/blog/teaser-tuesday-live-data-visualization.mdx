# Teaser Tuesday: Live Data Visualization

This week’s #TeaserTuesday is all about empowering users to make informed design decisions.

With live data visualization, you can use data to define graphic attributes — say, for example, you want to classify walls, walkways, and doors according to fire code standards. You can set the walls’ colors, so you have a visual reminder of what’s appended to the wall: restrictions, criteria, parameters, etc.

Data visualization first appeared in Vectorworks 2017, but back then it was confined to viewports. 2020 brings data to the forefront: right in the design layer where you make your design decisions. It’s a live working environment where you can accurately discern the impact of your data — an addition that goes a long way in designing intelligently. 

“Data is information. Information is knowledge. And we know that knowledge is power,” explained Hugues Tsaf ak, director of product development. 

This feature is a useful new way to make design changes and see their impact immediately — creating an all \- together proactive design environment.

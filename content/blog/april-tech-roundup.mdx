# Tech Roundup: April 2018

From making the move to Vectorworks, to our newest partnership with Bluebeam, this month’s tech roundup will keep you informed about all that is fresh in software design.

## Change Made Easy: Making the Move to Vectorworks

These guides will introduce you to key concepts of Vectorworks and how you can gain efficiency by adopting Vectorworks for your complete project cycle. The exercises in each tutorial are designed to help you understand the structure and behavior of Vectorworks to make the transition from SketchUp, Rhino, and/or Grasshopper to Vectorworks easier.

## A Wish Out of Water

Have a request or wish list item you want to share? Watch the tutorial video below and learn how to easily request a change to an existing feature, request a completely new feature in Vectorworks, or share your feedback to promote or demote the importance of any feature request in the wish list. 

## Make 3D Text Quick and Easy

Tired of having flat, 2D text in your designs? Learn the ins and outs of creating 3D text quickly and easily. Decide whether you'll use the Convert Text to Polylines command to create simple 3D text that can be scaled or extruded (but not edited afterward) or use the more sophisticated Text Along Path command to create 3D text with a variety of three-dimensional effects.

## Extra, Extra! News on the Vectorworks and Bluebeam Integration

The new Bluebeam integration creates a streamlined, cloud-based process for designers, architects, contractors, and owners to collaborate on PDF drawings and models. Learn more about this new collaboration below.

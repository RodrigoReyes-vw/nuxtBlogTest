# Vectorworks 2023 Service Pack 4 Released

###### **The release of Service Pack 4 for Vectorworks 2023 introduces game-changing tech integrations and feature optimizations to the software.**

This release responds to your need for powerful, easy-to-use features and connectivity with popular tech solutions. Keep reading and find out about the developments in the new release.

#### NVIDIA OMNIVERSE CONNECTOR

Through a collaboration with [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/), Vectorworks 2023 Service Pack 4 delivers a direct connection to NVIDIA [Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/creators/), a platform for developing and operating metaverse applications, via an integrated Omniverse Connector. The new plug-in connects Vectorworks 3D models straight to the [Universal Scene Description](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/)[ (USD)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/)\-based Omniverse platform. No longer needing to rely on incompatible file formats to import into the platform, you can save valuable time by eliminating steps for the import/export process with USD-based interoperability.

The new Connector also serves as a critical catalyst for further advancement, expanding your opportunities to contribute to and collaborate on the same 3D project at the same time, all while using your favorite design tools.

You can drive your collaborative efforts even further with newly added USD import and export capabilities. Supporting 3D geometry, texture and metadata, USD is the emerging standard in design and collaboration. Already used by Apple and NVIDIA, now you can tap into this cutting-edge file format to gain access to a world of exciting applications and technologies, as well as to work more efficiently with fellow designers and consultants.

#### SHEET LAYER VIEWPORT PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

Upgrades to Sheet Layer Viewports create a more responsive user interface, speeding up the documentation process and increasing performance and accuracy when viewing, rendering, and navigating sheet layers. Low-resolution previews of sheet layer viewport contents are created automatically with the option to snap easily with others’ viewports. This also reduces file size, making it easier for you to share your work with clients and collaborators.

#### NEW HARDSCAPE DRAPE MODE

To address the evolving needs of architects and landscape architects, newly added functionality allows you to conform hardscape objects to your site models. Hardscape objects in any configuration can now excavate the site model surface and accurately calculate the cut and fill volumes. Additionally, a new configuration mode allows you to “drape” hardscape objects to automatically conform to the surface of a site model, adding flexibility for different types of hardscape installations.

#### SOLAR ANIMATIONS PROCESSED VIA THE VECTORWORKS CLOUD

Taking advantage of the processing power of Vectorworks Cloud Services saves time when processing Solar Animation Exports. Historically, exporting a solar animation limited the ability to perform other tasks in Vectorworks. This new option sends animations to Vectorworks Cloud Services for processing, letting it do the heavy lifting in the background while you remain concentrated on your design.

#### FLEXIBILITY IN CLOUD PRESENTATIONS

Cloud Presentations have flexible layouts that offer more creative freedom and customizable options so you can showcase exactly what you need. You can now place images, text, and media anywhere on a presentation slide and select from system fonts to create compelling presentations for clients. 

#### STREAMLINED CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROCESSES WITH CABLE ROUTE SELECTION

In ConnectCAD, you can now deal with multiple signal streams as a result of significant improvements to the Cable Route Planning feature. Building on the recent Cable Route Planning improvements, the updates provide interactive selection among available cable route options for various main and backup signals in a system. This enhancement brings new options to the “edit cabling” dialog menu, giving visual indicators of all available cable routes and discerning information like diameter, total length, and more.

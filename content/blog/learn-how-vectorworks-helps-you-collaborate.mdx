# Vectorworks Tutorial Series | Collaboration

No matter what industry you may find yourself working in, collaboration is an important part of your day-to-day processes. Luckily, Vectorworks provides you with powerful features and capabilities to help you collaborate with a host of consultants.

In this tutorial series, you’ll find courses on the following topics:

1. Sharing projects in a multiuser environment
2. Collaborating with a BIM process
3. Globalizing collaboration with Project Sharing

After checking out these tutorials, be sure to check out our post last month. We shared [videos that will help boost the efficiency of your design process](/tutorial-series-time-effeciency?hs%5Fpreview=DftlGWqI-73992141489).

###### Sharing Projects in a Multiuser Environment

[Project Sharing](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/an-overview-of-project-sharing-in-vectorworks-software.html) in Vectorworks is a multiuser environment that streamlines your project management and execution. It was developed to help you manage files involving multiple in-office collaborators, fostering effective collaboration and communication within a project team. 

Learn more about Project Sharing by viewing the course below.

###### Collaborating with a Streamlined BIM Process

A BIM workflow allows your project’s process to be more efficient. You and your collaborators can take a variety of outputs from a single model. For example, you have the ability to perform external model validation with the [Solibri Direct connection](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/solibri-direct-feature-vectorworks-open-bim.html).

In this webinar below, you’ll learn about BIM adoption strategies used by [Studio Partington](https://www.studiopartington.co.uk/) as well as how new technologies helped them provide better quality models for collaboration using OpenBIM.

###### Globalizing Collaboration with Project Sharing 

Project Sharing in Vectoworks enables a powerful internal workflow that sets you up for effective collaboration with consultants around the world.

In this case study-style webinar, Peter Pihlblad, [Creative Technology Sweden CAD](https://www.ct-group.com/se/), will tell you how to collaborate by first using Project Sharing. The designer will explain how he worked with an external audio engineer, video engineer, and production manager to produce a successful event.

# Design Resolutions to Set in 2022

As we move through the first quarter of 2022, there’s still time to set some design resolutions for the rest of the year!

This blog will examine a few industry trends to give you a solid baseline for setting design goals for the rest of the year. 

At the end of this post, you’ll find a survey with a few short questions about what you’re working towards. In December, we’ll publish the most common answers so you can see what your Vectorworks peers are working on!

We’ll be discussing:

* Sustainability
* Open-standard collaboration
* Visualization

###### Sustainability 

We’re not here to preach. It’s common knowledge that the environment needs to be taken care of.

If you haven’t started incorporating sustainable solutions into your design process, there’s no better time than now. And if you have, there’s always room to do more.

Check out this blog on the Vectorworks Embodied Carbon Calculator (VECC), which is an easy way to evaluate embodied CO2 levels, a growing concern in the AEC industry. Learning how to use the downloadable VECC worksheet is a great goal as you’ll be able to learn and adapt your projects to lower embodied carbon levels.

[Download your VECC worksheet here](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/calculate-embodied-carbon-with-this-vectorworks-worksheet.html)!

For those using Vectorworks Landmark, consider ways you can conserve more water in your designs. The American Society of Landscape Architecture (ASLA) reports that the average American household uses 320 gallons of water per day, about 30% of which is for outdoor purposes. The organization wrote [a helpful article on how to save water in your landscape designs](https://www.asla.org/watersavingtips.aspx).

###### Open-Standard Collaboration

Learning about and implementing open-standard file formats are fantastic goalposts for 2022\. Even if you don't plan on using these file formats, it'll help to be familiar with them so you're not caught off guard when you come across them in a project.

Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)

IFC is the universal language of building information modeling (BIM). It's used to share a range of model and project information with other stakeholders who might be using a different software program than you. 

There's certainly a lot to cover when it comes to IFC. For now, take a look at these two documents from Vectorworks University. They'll give you an overview of how useful the file formats are, and if you're looking into using IFC yourself this year, there's tons of information in the video on how to do so within Vectorworks Architect and Landmark.

GDTF & MVR

These two file formats — General Device Type Format and My Virtual Rig respectively — remove proprietary boundaries when moving your design between CAD, previz, and control software. 

More and more designers are discovering the benefits of these unifying formats, as are manufacturers. If you design in entertainment, incorporating these formats into your workflow is a fantastic goal to set, as they’ll save you and your collaborators tons of time. There’s a great delight to being able to transfer model and fixture data between software programs with ease.

Learn more about the file formats and explore the manufacturers available at [gdtf-share.com](https://gdtf-share.com/?cont=share). 

###### Visualization

[Visualization has been a hot topic on Planet Vectorworks](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/vectorworks-tutorial-series-visualization.html), and that’s because more and more we’re seeing designers find success by making it a key step in their process.

Visualization can mean a variety of things — rendering, [data visualization](https://university.vectorworks.net/course/view.php?id=223), [AR/VR](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/how-to-transition-from-2d-vr-visualization.html), or it can even be a blanket term for graphically rich models.

For many clients, renderings are an effective way to interpret your design intent. Bob Shepp of West Highland Design says that, in his 20+ years designing, [every project he’s rendered has been bought by a client](https://www.vectorworks.net/customer-showcase/the-evocative-renderings-of-west-highland-design-a-study-in-switching-to-vectorworks).

Lumion, Twinmotion, Enscape, and the native Renderworks are all options available to those using Vectorworks. You’re not at a loss for easy-to-use rendering programs that produce great results.

###### Share Your Design Resolutions with Us!

Those are a few topics that are popular in the architecture, landscape, and/or entertainment design industries, and are a good place to look when setting your design resolutions.

Of course, you could resolve to accomplish so many different things this year outside of those topics. We’d love to hear what you’re working towards. Take a moment to answer this question anonymously and at the end of the year we’ll share what the most popular answers are!

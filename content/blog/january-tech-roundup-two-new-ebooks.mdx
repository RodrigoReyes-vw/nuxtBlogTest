## Switching to Vectorworks: CAD Manager Guide

BIM managers — now you can feel more at ease learning how to convert your office’s existing resources with this guide in switching to Vectorworks from AutoCAD.

Similar to the Design Center in AutoCAD, the Resource Manager allows you to manage, convert, classify, and organize your resources in a time-efficient set-up. No need to worry about your office archives, as Vectorworks has powerful Import/Export capabilities to ensure they transition over.

[Download the BIM Manager Guide to Resource Management for more information on managing your resources.](https://www.vectorworks.net/ebooks/bim-manager-guide-to-resource-management?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=callout&utm%5Fcontent=jantechroundup011620)

## 2D Components for Hybrid Objects in Vectorworks

In Vectorworks [Architect](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/architect?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=jantechroundup011620), [Landmark](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/landmark?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=jantechroundup011620), and [Spotlight](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/spotlight?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=jantechroundup011620), 2D Components for Hybrid Objects allows you to create 2D graphics for your 3D symbols and plug-in objects (PIOs) to easily present these objects at various levels of detail.

Use 2D and 3D hybrid symbol technology for all the standard views, not just Top/Plan view, combined with changing the level of detail so your symbols and PIOs can display the appropriate detail throughout a set of drawings.

For BIM Levels of Development (LODs), you can set up your 2D levels of detail to correspond with LOD 100, 200, and 300.

**_For those working in the UK, Vectorworks’ levels are the equivalent to LOD 1, 2, and 3\._**

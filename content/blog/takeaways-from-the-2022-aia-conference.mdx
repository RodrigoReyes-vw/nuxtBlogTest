# Takeaways from the 2022 AIA Conference

There‚Äôs no opportunity quite like the yearly AIA conference for the US architecture community to come together and celebrate their profession.

This year‚Äôs conference was no different, with hundreds of learning sessions and vendors all with a common goal: to advance the field of architecture to meet the demands of the modern world. It can be considered as the biggest architecture event of the year, especially when you consider the list of presenters, which includes [President Barack Obama and his closing session](https://conferenceonarchitecture.com/president-barack-obama/).

Read on to see our takeaways from the [AIA Conference on Architecture 2022](https://conferenceonarchitecture.com/). Even if you weren‚Äôt able to attend, this blog contains several resources related to one of the most popular sold-out sessions!

###### Sold-Out Session: ‚ÄúEmbodied Carbon: New Measuring Tools & Strategies‚Äù

The conference provided a fantastic learning opportunity for architects who are in the process of adjusting their workflows to address the environmental footprint of their building projects.

The headline session, ‚ÄúEmbodied Carbon: New Measuring Tools & Strategies,‚Äù called attention to the AIA 2030 Commitment‚Äôs Design Data Exchange adding reporting of embodied carbon to its requirements. It‚Äôs clear that reducing embodied carbon emissions is priority for the AIA and many architects.

Measuring and reporting embodied carbon is of course the first step to implementing reduction strategies. It‚Äôs a big reason why Vectorworks sponsored this sold-out course ‚Äî [our Vectorworks Embodied Carbon Calculator (VECC)](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/calculate-embodied-carbon-with-this-vectorworks-worksheet.html) underscores a commitment to the course‚Äôs subject matter ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a huge topic of interest for the architecture industry as it works towards producing more sustainable buildings.

There are plentiful resources available for understanding the impact embodied carbon has on our environment. Be sure to check out [this webinar that explores use of the Vectorworks Embodied Carbon Calculator](https://university.vectorworks.net/course/view.php?id=2043), as well as [this blog that discusses ways to reduce embodied carbon emissions](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/strategies-for-designing-towards-net-zero-carbon.html).

###### Tours of Chicago Architecture

It‚Äôs fitting that a conference focused on architecture be hosted in a city as architecturally rich as Chicago. What‚Äôs more, the AIA organized tours of architecturally significant buildings as well as visits to architecture firms who call Chicago home.

There were dozens of tour destinations from iconic structures like the silver bean in Millennium Park to affordable and mixed-income housing across the city. What better way to celebrate Chicago architecture than by experiencing it yourself?

###### Showing Off Vectorworks Architect

Architecture today is faced with a variety of challenges, from reducing embodied and operational carbon emissions to adapting to new and evolving technologies and workflows.

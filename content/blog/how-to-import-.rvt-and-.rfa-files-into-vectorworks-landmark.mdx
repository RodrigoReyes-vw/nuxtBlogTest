# Importing Revit Files into Vectorworks Landmark

Picture your history of site design work. How often have you collaborated with architects who use Revit?

Was your answer “at least once?” Then you’re probably skeptical of how well other design solutions can handle RVT and RFA files.

Fortunately, Vectorworks Landmark boasts some practical and reliable features for collaborating via Revit files. In this blog, you’ll see an overview of Vectorworks’ capabilities for interoperability with Revit and get access to a guide written by our landscape industry specialists.

## Importing Revit Files into Vectorworks Landmark

So, you’re ready to start designing in Landmark and the consulting architects send you a Revit file. To import, select File > Import > Import Revit, then select the file you’d like to import. This will display a the RVT/RFA Import Options menu that presents you with a variety of checkbox options to customize the import, such as: 

1. Import active view only, import 3D model view only, or import 2D and 3D views
2. Create native Vectorworks objects on import
3. If not creating native Vectorworks objects, import Vectorworks mesh objects, groups of 3D polygons, or Vectorworks solid objects
4. Import textures and texture mapping

Take advantage of the ability to import native Vectorworks objects as you’ll be able to easily edit their data and linked [documentation](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/tutorial-series-documentation.html).

Upon import, you’ll notice that a Vectorworks design layer was created for each Revit level. You can manage these layers as you normally would, whether that be toggling visibility settings or simultaneously editing graphical attributes of all geometry in the layer.

## Creating a Digital Terrain Model from Revit Source Data

With the building in your design layer, you’re probably ready to start on your digital terrain model, known as a site model in Vectorworks. If you have imported terrain source data from Revit, you can easily use it to create an intelligent site model in Vectorworks Landmark. Select Landmark > Create Site Model > Create Model from Source Data. You’ll see the Site Model Settings menu where you can edit information like minimum/maximum elevation and contour intervals/multipliers.

 With the site model created, you can visit the Graphic Properties menu to colorize different elevations and slopes. You’ll have a well-defined, customizable site model with this method.

## Importing Revit Family (RFA) Objects with Maintained Data Records

Aside from your consultants, you may have acquired manufacturer-created content in the Revit Family (RFA) format. If manufacturers supplied you with .RFA files for various objects like site furniture, you could easily import them into Vectorworks Landmark’s drag-and-drop interface with their data records maintained. Select File > Import > Import Revit (Batch). This will bring up a menu where you can individually select objects for import or choose to import all objects in a selected folder.

For documenting these objects, attached Revit data is easily accessible in the Object Info palette.

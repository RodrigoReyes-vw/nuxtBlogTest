# Explore the New Cabinet Tool in Vectorworks 2024

Designing the perfect interior can be a daunting task. There are so many elements to consider, from the layout to the materials used. But with the **Parametric Cabinet** tool in Vectorworks 2024, creating your client’s dream space just got easier. 

With just one tool, you can unleash your creativity and design endless combinations of custom base, wall, and tall cabinets. Plus, you can choose from a wide range of cabinet configurations from popular catalogs.

####  Create Any Cabinet

The Parametric Cabinet tool is located in your **Furniture and Fixtures** tool set.

To start creating your cabinets, you can choose from standard placementmodes or from two dynamic placement modes. With these modes, you can quickly lay out an entire kitchen, bathroom, or any other space in need of cabinetry.

For an in-depth look into the functionality of the tool, watch the video below:

#### Flexibility of Textures and Materials

The Parametric Cabinet tool offers a wide range of possibilities when it comes to materials, allowing you to personalize your 3D attributes. Whether you prefer to organize your design by class, texture, or material, the choice is yours.

With the ability to report material quantities, you can easily keep track of how much material you are using for your cabinet, helping you plan and estimate your project’s cost with accuracy.![Materials](https://blog.vectorworks.net/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/231110_INT%202024%20Cabinet/Materials.png?width=1440&height=1361&name=Materials.png)

The Parametric Cabinet tool also lets you override textures on a cabinet's interior faces and the exterior and back sides. This gives you endless options for customization. Each element can be tailored to your liking, from the individual sides to the interior and even the shelves, enhancing the visual appeal of your design and adding depth and character to your virtual creation.

#### 2D Attributes

Just as you have flexibility with the textures and materials of your cabinets, you have a ton of choices when it comes to your cabinets’ 2D attributes.

By using separate **Classes**, you have the flexibility to highlight specific details and features of each cabinet type. For example, you can choose to emphasize the swing and toekick in top/plan views, providing a comprehensive representation of the cabinets' functionality.

This level of customization not only enhances the visual appeal of the design but also helps in accurately documenting the intended information to clients or builders. 

So, whether you're working on a residential or commercial project, the option to set separate classes for cabinet components can greatly enhance your design process. It allows for clear communication, precise detailing, and ultimately, the perfect design that meets the unique needs and preferences of your clients.

# Teaser Tuesday: Class & Layer Filters for Vectorworks 2019

Teaser Tuesday is back! Here’s your chance for a sneak peek at updates to come in Vectorworks 2019\. This Teaser Tuesday, we’re showing you a Vectorworks 2019 update that will help you save time and make your workflow even smoother.

Most design files end up with more classes and layers than one can easily manage. In Vectorworks 2019, we’ve taken steps to increase efficiency by adding the ability to search, filter, and add tags to layers and classes. This means you can instantly find what you’re looking for by typing in a keyword search or using filters to display class and layers based upon specific properties. Watch the video below to see the full capabilities.

“As the amount of data in BIM files increases, it gets harder to find and manage classes and layers," said Chad Hamilton, AIA, LEED AP, Principal Architect at Hamilton + Aitken Architects. "The new layer and class filters help sort through this information so we can quickly find what we need. This is a huge improvement, especially for offices doing more complex projects.”

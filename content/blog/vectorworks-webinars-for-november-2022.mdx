# November Webinars: Laser Design, BIM Collaboration, & BIM Adoption

Maintain accreditation and earn continuing education credits with Vectorworks’ monthly webinars. Whether you’re a beginner or experienced designer, you can gain new skills, fine-tune workflows, and discover all you can do with Vectorworks.

## Laser Designs | Vectorworks, Vision, & Beyond

_Aired November 9_

Laser designs are sure to take your live event up to a whole new level. When creating such designs, previsualization is essential in ensuring efficient delivery and safety for attendees and staff members alike.

In this webinar, Lyra Letourneau, creative director for [Pangolin Laser Systems](https://pangolin.com), and Jim Woodward, Vectorworks’ senior entertainment product specialist, will provide you with a walkthrough of laser design. Learn best practices when setting up lasers in your Vectorworks design and how to successfully add lasers to your Vision model. Letourneau and Woodward will also discuss efficiently linking your Vision model to Pangolin’s BEYOND control software.

## Demystifying BIM Collaboration

_Aired November 15_

Collaborating using a Building Information Model (BIM) can be done in a variety of ways, and there isn’t just one tool or one method available. These varied collaboration workflows depend on the needs of your project and the skill levels of your team members involved. 

One key factor of BIM collaboration is the ability for each team member to use the software of choice that fits their tasks and can offer collaboration opportunities with others. To serve this, flexible design tools and open standards can provide ways to work with others while removing the need to use (or learn) unfamiliar software with limited, rigid workflow options. 

This webinar will demystify the options for BIM collaboration so you can make an informed decision about the best method for your needs on any given project.

This webinar is also approved for one AIA LU.

## Strategies for Adopting BIM in Landscape Architecture

_Aired November 17_

Landscape architecture firms considering the move from traditional CAD workflows to BIM face a similar dilemma as they did years ago in transitioning to CAD from hand drawing.

This presentation will share strategies for your organization to consider when developing a transition plan for BIM implementation. From assessing your firm’s current use of design and modeling software, to meeting BIM collaboration requirements and identifying where support is most needed, we provide a series of questions to ask yourself as you carry out this assessment and determine how to make office-wide changes for BIM integration.

This webinar is also approved with one LA CES PDH and APLD CEU.

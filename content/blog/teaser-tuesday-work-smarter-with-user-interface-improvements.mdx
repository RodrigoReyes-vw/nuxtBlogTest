# Teaser Tuesday: Work Smarter with User Interface Improvements

We’re here for our third behind-the-scenes look at upcoming enhancements you’ll find with #Vectorworks2021\. This week, we’re talking about some significant improvements to the user interface.

The first is the new Quick Search functionality, which means you can quickly find and activate any tool or menu command simply by typing what you need. Moreover, Vectorworks will make suggestions based on your search and most-used tools.

Next up is the Smart Options Display, which allows you to change tools, modes, and views without moving your mouse from the drawing area or without memorizing keyboard shortcuts. Better yet, the Smart Options Display is customizable, so you can easily access your most-used tool sets and last-used tools right at the tip of your cursor!

**“One of the most innovative features is the Smart Options Display. This tool alone will save countless miles of mouse travel, which translates to time savings. Having it customizable makes it an even better new feature.”**

– Jeff Miller, Founder of J Miller Production Services, LLC

With both of these updates, you can completely hide your tool palettes to save valuable screen space. The time savings and streamlined operations will truly revolutionize your workflows.

Join the conversation in the Vectorworks Forum, where you’ll find videos from our software engineering team on enhancements to 3D modeling and the Vectorworks Graphics Module in the new version.

###### **Abstract: The Art of Design**

Each episode focuses on one innovator, showcasing the impact of design on every aspect of life. Fun fact: there are two Vectorworks users highlighted in the first season.

###### **The Creative Brain**

Follow Neuroscientist David Eagleman in this [one-hour documentary](https://www.netflix.com/title/81090128) as he explores how the creative process works and what we can do to spark it. You’ll be surprised at how some of the subjects — innovators from a variety of fields — tap into creativity and use it to better their own lives and those of others.

###### **Chef’s Table**

Brought to you by the director of “Jiro Dreams of Sushi,” another one of our favorites, this [six-volume series](https://www.netflix.com/title/80007945) goes behind the scenes at some of the world’s top fine dining restaurants. Take a look into the minds of world-renowned chefs and discover what inspires their culinary masterpieces. Maybe the careful curation of each dish will spark a design idea of your own.

###### **Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry**

This [hour-and-a-half documentary](https://www.netflix.com/title/70229921) showcases the work of Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei, who inspires his social media followers to speak out against injustice. His influence has sparked protests — causing him to suffer government persecution — and spread awareness of unspoken social issues in the face of censorship. Watching Weiwei employ his talents to enact change reminds us of the true value and power of art in all its forms.

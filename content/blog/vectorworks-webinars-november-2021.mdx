# November Webinars: Game Show Lighting, Twinmotion, & Efficient Design

Maintain accreditation and earn continuing education credits with Vectorworks’ monthly webinars. Whether you are a beginner or experienced designer, you can gain new skills, fine-tune workflows, and discover all you can do with Vectorworks.

###### Entertainment | Lighting Production for ITV’s New Game Show

_Aired on Thursday, November 11_

Max Conwell from [Naked Eye Ltd.](https://www.nakedeyelighting.com/), will take you behind the scenes of _The Void_ — ITV’s new Saturday night game show. The webinar will demonstrate how Vectorworks Spotlight and ConnectCAD’s clear and concise networking and data layouts were used for the lighting design. When collaborating with the various design departments on the show, multiple file formats were produced. And, in this webinar, Conwell will show how these formats integrated seamlessly into the master Vectorworks file. Today, face-to-face meetings are few and far between, so the clarity of communication in design documentation is vital to a successful production.

###### Architecture | Revolutionize Your Rendering with Vectorworks and Twinmotion

_Aired Tuesday, November 16_ 

Join Jonathan Reeves, UK architect and real-time rendering expert, to see how easy it is to upgrade your presentations with renderings, animations, and interactive cloud presentations. Reeves will also show how Vectorworks’ 3D models can be developed, exported to Twinmotion, and easily updated to create interactive presentations for clients.

You’ll learn how to refine textures and lighting to produce photo-realistic renderings, as well as how to add context to high-quality animations with landscape, plantings, and entourage.

Those with Vectorworks 2022 can benefit from the new Twinmotion Direct Link with a free Twinmotion license. The offer is valid through March 31, 2022\.

###### Landscape | Maximizing Landscape Design-Build Efficiency with Technology

_Aired Wednesday, November 17_ 

During the Great Recession, landscape architect and owner of a mid-size design-build company Joe Hanauer decided to “tech up.” His goal then was to be a one-person design-build office. Now, with labor markets tight, using technology to create efficiencies for installation crews is increasingly important. 

With hardware including a tablet, computer, GPS Surveyor, altimeter level and camera, combined with software for note taking, estimating and designing this session will reveal how they are all essential to creating an efficient workflow from first call to last shovel. This session will also show how this “almost-paper-free” technology workflow can be used to run a one-person office and scaled to work with larger firms, too.

This course is approved for 1 LA CES and 1 APLD CEU.

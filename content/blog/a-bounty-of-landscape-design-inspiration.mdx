# A Bounty of Landscape Design Inspiration

Edamarie Mattei, owner of landscape firm [Backyard Bounty](http://backyardbounty.net/) in Silver Spring, Maryland, has followed a storied career path, and landscape architecture was not always a part of it. After graduating from Georgetown University, she became a 9th grade English teacher in New York City’s South Bronx. She then went on to be a teacher trainer, where she taught in Montgomery County, Maryland, as well as in California. It was in California where she developed a passion for gardening that led her back to school to study landscape design and horticulture.

Mattei founded Backyard Bounty, an organic company dedicated to improving the environment by re-imagining the American garden, in 2008\. Backyard Bounty designs, installs, and maintains gardens and outdoor living spaces good for both the environment and clients. 

Mattei’s creative drive stems from her passion to learn about how things grow, and especially how they can grow efficiently and beautifully. “I find solace from the outdoors, especially as we live more and more in front of screens,” she explains. “I have a passion for bringing people out into nature. Being outside is such a mood lifter.”

Mattei may not have always been involved in landscape design, but deep down she knew she had an interest in it. “I spent a lot of time building with Legos and doll houses when I was a kid,” she says. “This is what I’ve always loved to do and had a passion for, but no one told me I could do it as a career!”

Mattei and her team started using [Vectorworks](http://www.vectorworks.net/landmark?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=backyardbounty01302018) about 2 years ago. “Vectorworks is a lifesaver,” she says. “Landscape design is really dynamic, so having the capability to get calculations simply has truly been a lifesaver.” Mattei and her employees had a fair amount of up-front learning and time investments when they first started using Vectorworks, but the payoff down the road was substantial.

Vectorworks helps simplify Backyard Bounty’s design process because the team can easily manage projects more efficiently while easily communicating with clients. Of the features in Vectorworks, Mattei says she is most excited about the expanding plant library. She also likes how her team can edit plant graphics in the way they want them to appear to create a clean-lined look.

When it comes to being a woman in the primarily male-dominated world of landscaping, Mattei has advice for those who may be questioning their role in this industry: “Know you bring important and powerful skills to the table,” she says. “You are all beneficial to the clients. Know the value of who you are, and be confident of that value.”

# It’s Time to Get Up to Speed on GDTF

The [General Device Type Format (GDTF)](https://gdtf-share.com/) made quite the impression when it was first announced at last year’s [Prolight + Sound](https://pls.messefrankfurt.com/frankfurt/en.html), and the entertainment industry’s open file format continues to evolve with its latest development: GDTF 1.0\. 

Through collective feedback from our fellow GDTF founders, [MA Lighting](https://www.malighting.com/) and [Robe lighting](https://www.robe.cz/), as well as other participating manufacturers, the file format can now be used by manufacturers around the world. GDTF 1.0 and the My Virtual Rig (MVR) file format — which creates a two-way connection between planning, previz, and console systems — are now implemented with Vectorworks 2019, Vision 2019, and grandMA3.

_Spotlight and Vision now import MVR_

Most recently, revisions to the new file format include improvements to the following:

* DMX mode
* Geometry type
* Physical descriptions of emitters, filters, and color space
* Date and user stamp on all uploaded GDTF files

Further, official documentation now lives [online](https://gdtf-share.com/wiki/GDTF%5FFile%5FDescription) and offers GDTF and MVR file descriptions, GDTF tutorials, an MVR portable library, and more.

_General Device Type Format_ 

Previously in private beta, the web-based fixture builder, which allows manufacturers to create GDTF files for their fixtures, is updated in GDTF version 1.0 and available at <https://gdtf-share.com/>. The fixture builder also allows manufacturers and end users to create GDTF files for lighting fixtures. Manufacturers interested in moving forward with creating GDTF files for their fixtures can receive access to the fixture builder and a private beta of grandMA3 onPC xPort Node and grandMA3 onPC software to import GDTF and MVR files for testing their build process with real output.

This announcement comes a week after we announced [Vectorworks 2019 Service Pack 3](https://www.vectorworks.net/news/press-releases/vectorworks-inc-announces-lumion-live-sync-rendering-linked-panoramas-and-my-virtual-rig-advancement?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fcontent=gdtf032819&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext), along with significant advancements to the MVR connection between our products. Now, you can import and export MVR in Spotlight and import MVR into Vision, providing a more efficient workflow to designers.

See the new MVR workflow from Spotlight to Vision. 

If you’re attending Prolight + Sound this year, be sure to come by our booth at **Hall 12.0, C51** to see these latest developments in person.

And for those of you not making the trip to Frankfurt, Germany, check out our products that now import a MVR file format.

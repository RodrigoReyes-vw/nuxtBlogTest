# Your Guide to Real-Time Rendering with Lumion

Creating beautiful visualizations of your Vectorworks designs with [Lumion's](https://lumion.com/whats-new.html?gclid=CjwKCAjw9LSSBhBsEiwAKtf0n1VBKj4M-Zj429flv7QL1f8QPjGojl4d8iMV%5FTZCc7%5FXmdIdwWyTsRoCB68QAvD%5FBwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) LiveSync plugin is a great way to captivate your clients.

We’ve previously highlighted several rendering options on this blog, for example: 
* [Rendering with Renderworks](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/renderworks-renderings-powered-by-maxon.html)
* [Rendering with Twinmotion](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/your-guide-to-rendering-with-twinmotion.html)
* [Rendering with Enscape](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/your-guide-to-real-time-rendering-with-enscape.html)

In this post, you’ll learn how Lumion, a [Vectorworks Platinum Partner](https://www.vectorworks.net/community/partner-network/find-partner), is a stellar rendering option if you’re designing on a PC.

But first, let’s review just how renderings can revolutionize your design workflow.

## Why Create Renderings?

Some designers shy away from rendering because it’s an additional step in the process, one that uses computer resources and time to accomplish.

But the benefits of producing a rendering far outweigh the time costs, and here’s why:

* Clients sometimes aren’t specialized enough to faithfully interpret drawings, plans, or models. A fully visualized space is easier for clients to understand and ultimately approve.
* Clients often appreciate the ability to visualize the project before it’s built, not unlike how you’d want to test drive a car before committing to the purchase.
* A rendering can help visualize and quality check a material selection.

So, by including renderings in your presentation packages, you’re ultimately helping guide consultants and clients through a smoother review and approval process, which can lead to savings in time and money for all parties.

You can capitalize on rendering’s many advantages with the help of Vectorworks and Lumion.

## Rendering with Lumion

[According to their website](https://lumion.com/product.html), Lumion isn’t “your typical architectural visualization software.” Instead, the software prides itself on creating “intuitive and inspiring” renderings that’ll help take your project — whether it be an architectural, interior, landscape, or other design project — to the next level.

[With the newest version of Lumion](https://lumion.com/whats-new.html#content), rendering will feel like an integral part of your design workflow, and realistic graphics will be right at your fingertips.

## How to Render with Vectorworks and Lumion

Rendering with Lumion in Vectorworks is made possible with the LiveSync plugin. The rendering option is easy to use and will have you on your way to creating stunning renderings for presentations in no time at all. 

Just follow these simple steps to begin rendering with Vectorworks and Lumion:

1. Create a 3D model in Vectorworks
2. Install Lumion
3. Open Lumion
4. Enable the LiveSync option in Lumion

When using the LiveSync plugin, your 3D Vectorworks model will automatically populate your Lumion rendering. The camera linking feature will also ensure that the view of your design is identical in both software.

Any changes you make to your model — whether it be adding, moving, or deleting objects — will be duplicated almost instantly in Lumion. 

With real-time updates to your model, you can design and follow your creativity wherever it may lead you. You won’t be burdened by the stresses of manually modifying your Lumion file. Your rendering simply updates for you automatically!

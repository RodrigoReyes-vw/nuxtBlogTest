## Getting Started Seminars

_All industries - June 16 & 23, 2020_

Our Getting Started seminars are designed for those who are new to [Vectorworks](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=061520freetraining) software. The presenters will explore important topics like the user interface, common tools and commands, and getting the most out of the hybrid 2D/3D environment.

Attendees will come away feeling more confident about their journey with Vectorworks.

## Essentials Seminars

Essentials courses are for those who have a familiarity with the software but are looking to take it to the next level. 

You’ll learn about common workflows in your industry as well as information needed to be successful in using the software. Topics include importing files, file setup and organization, efficient drawing techniques, and presentation capabilities. 

Here’s the schedule through the end of June. All Essentials sessions occur at 1 p.m. ET.

* Spotlight Essentials - June 16
* Vision Essentials - June 18
* Architect Essentials - June 24
* Braceworks Essentials - June 25
* Landmark Essentials - June 30

## Hidden Treasures Seminars

Hidden Treasures Seminars are all about uncovering hidden gems — those lesser-known capabilities that can substantially improve the way you work. 

This month, we have a Hidden Treasures session happening on the 18th. 

## Workflow Seminars

Workflow seminars take specific Vectorworks capabilities and deconstruct them down to their basics. These sessions are good for those who desire mastery of a particular tool, concept, or workflow. 

Here are the June topics. These brand new sessions are hosted by Vectorworks UK training staff and occur at 8 a.m. ET.

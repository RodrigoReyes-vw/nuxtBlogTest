#### Relive the Action | Looking Back to Design Day 2022

Wondering what kinds of presentations you can expect at [Design Day 2023](https://designday.vectorworks.net/)? Take a look back at the 2022 events in the UK and Canada. Many talented designers discussed how they’re using Vectorworks to achieve beautiful and bespoke design solutions.

###### Design Day UK 2022

Iain Lyon and Lisa McRavey, landscape architects at RaeburnFarquharBowen, used Vectorworks Landmark and Esri ArcGIS mapping software to explore potential improvements along the 134-mile John Muir Way. Their findings were presented in an interactive story map, offering a dynamic and accessible experience for public consultation.

Niall Williams, director of ND Landscape Architects and host of the Vectorworks-sponsored People, Place & Nature podcast, teamed up with Water Offsets CEO Tapiwa Gavaza to discuss the increasing problems of water scarcity in some areas of the UK, particularly in the South East. 

Studio Partington used Vectorworks' Embodied Carbon Calculator tool — Bronze Stevie Awards winner for the 20th annual International Business Awards — for their proposals to replace the facade of Crescent House. This technology helped balance the preservation of history with the reduction of operational carbon. The project showcases how Vectorworks' native carbon and energy calculation tools empowers you to seamlessly integrate these processes into everyday design workflows.

[Starbucks' interior design team](https://university.vectorworks.net/course/view.php?id=2388) highlighted the flexibility of Vectorworks in improving their workflow. By using Vectorworks and implementing BIM principles, standardized file templates, and centralized 3D resource libraries, the team was able to streamline their design process from 11 weeks to just four weeks.

###### Design Day Canada 2022 Recap

Charles Britton and Jordi Ashworth of McFarland Marceau Architects discussed their firm's recent transition to a BIM workflow. They discussed major breakthroughs in their transition, which involved file setup, automation, tools, coordination, and change management. They briefly discussed how training with Vectorworks team supported their transition, and presented their pilot project, Gitxsan West Secondary School.

Scott Irvine and Kayla Poch of PWL Parntership Landscape Architects, Inc. reflected on the lessons they learned as they integrated BIM in their design process. They presented their project, TriCity Central - North Site, and shared their site modeling process for the project. They also shared the challenges they faced in their first BIM project, and the solutions they found.

Robert Sondergaard of Electric Aura Projects presented his design process for the 2021 Grey Cup Halftime show from conception to game day. He discussed how Vectorworks was essential in the design process and was used to create detailed working drawings while also being able to produce renderings to communicate with stakeholders.

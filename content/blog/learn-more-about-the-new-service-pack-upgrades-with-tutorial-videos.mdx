# Vectorworks Tutorial Series | Service Pack 3 Upgrades

Attention readers, [Service Pack 3](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/service-pack-3-now-available-for-vectorworks-2022.html) is now available for Vectorworks 2022! In this post, we’ll share videos on Service Pack 3 and the improvements it brings to Vectorworks 2022.

Last month, [we covered webinars that will boost your rendering workflow](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/vectorworks-webinars-on-rendering.html). 

The videos in today’s tutorial series will cover the following upgrades:

1. Datasmith direct link to Twinmotion
2. Unity®-based Nomad app and Web View upgrades
3. Vectorworks Cloud Services improvements

## Datasmith Direct Link to Twinmotion

Epic Games’ [Twinmotion](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/your-guide-to-rendering-with-twinmotion.html) is a premier real-time rendering solution for Mac and Windows operating systems. It runs on the Unreal Engine, the same engine used for popular video games like Fortnite.

And with Service Pack 3, there are improvements to Twinmtotion’s Datasmith direct link, which allows you continually update design models in Vectorworks.

Watch the video below to learn how it’ll be easier than ever to use the power of Vectorworks and still maintain a docile model in Twinmotion.

With Service Pack 3 you’ll be able to experience game-changing enhancements to the Vectorworks Nomad App and Web View capabilities. Specifically, you can now open large 3D models with complex geometry from web or your mobile device without having to sacrifice any aspect of your design.

You likely work across many different devices and in many different locations; but now, your design can do so much more efficiently! Watch the following webinar to learn more about the upgrade.

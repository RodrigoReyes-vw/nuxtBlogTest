# December Webinars: The Story of BIM, AV Workflows, & BIM For Landscape

Maintain accreditation and earn continuing education credits with Vectorworks’ monthly webinars. Whether you are a beginner or experienced designer, you can gain new skills, fine-tune workflows, and discover all you can do with Vectorworks.

###### BIM Has Always Been Here 

_Tuesday, December 14 | 2 pm EST_

Building Information Modeling (BIM) is often mistaken as a relatively new workflow, but it’s been around far longer than many of us know. BIM — at its most basic level — is a combination of geometry and data, which designers have been using for millennia.   
  
This webinar explores the history of BIM, examines the tools influencing current BIM workflows, and offers a glimpse into future technologies for designers.

This course is approved for one AIA LU, CORE AIBC, AAA, OAA, ALBNL, AANB, and NSAA.

###### A Complete AV Design Workflow 

_Wednesday, December 15 | 2 pm EST_

Is your design workflow in need of a lift? Join Tom White, industry specialist and training consultant at Vectorworks, for a webinar that will discuss common challenges in entertainment design. White will show you his innovative solutions to these problems, walking you through a complete AV design workflow — from modeled elements in Vectorworks to schematics in ConnectCAD.

###### When It Has To Be BIM

_Thursday, December 16 | 2 pm EST_

Landscape architecture is evolving, and BIM is becoming more important than ever. Join Todd McCurdy, FASLA to explore an example project in which workflows using BIM software were used throughout the design process. McCurdy will show the benefits of BIM on a new restaurant site, in a pedestrian zone, where planting, steps, ramps, grading, and drainage are all part of the landscape architect's scope. Like most multidisciplinary design team projects, Todd will share how crucial IFC exchanges are when each participant is using a different BIM solution, and how easily these files can be shared among team members to guide design direction with project stakeholders.

 This course is approved for  one LA CES PDH and one APLD CEU.

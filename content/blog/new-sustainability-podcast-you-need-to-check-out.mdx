# PODCAST | Environmental Sustainability

The new [People Place and Nature podcast](https://peopleplaceandnature.com/) series by [ND Landscape Architects](https://ndla.co.uk/) seeks to raise awareness for environmental sustainability through conversations with industry leaders including designers, scientists, and researchers. It’s an effort to highlight the incredible innovations happening in this field that aren’t heard about often.

It’s a topic we’re passionate about at Vectorworks. From our work developing the [Vectorworks Embodied Carbon Calculator](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/calculate-embodied-carbon-with-this-vectorworks-worksheet.html) to [talking with firms on how they can use the software to make informed and sustainable decisions](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/customer-showcase/bim-sustainable-landscape-architecture), being environmentally friendly is a important to us. Our dedicated HR team also has a program in place to [up our recycling and reduce waste office-wide](https://www.vectorworks.net/news/press-releases/vectorworks-inc-wins-howard-countys-business-recycling-and-waste-reduction-award).

It's why we’re thrilled to sponsor episodes of the People Place and Nature podcast. Here’s a bit of information about it as well as links to where you can listen yourself.

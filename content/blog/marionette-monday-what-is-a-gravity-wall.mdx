# Marionette Monday: What Is a Gravity Wall?

A gravity wall, a type of retaining wall, is commonly used in landscape architecture. Gravity walls may have batter setbacks for improved stability. They can be constructed with segmental blocks, stone masonry, or cast \- in \- place concrete. Here’s how you can design one with segmental blocks quickly and accurately with our algorithmic modeling tool, Marionette.

_A gravity wall made with Marionette._ 

This Marionette object creates a gravity wall based on a folder of symbols and a polyline path . Within the Object Info palette (OIP), you can set the overall height, the angle at which the wall is battered , and the pattern of the different symbols that will make up the wall. You can also offset this pattern on each row using a slider. 

This wall is built entirely of Vectorworks symbols, making it easily quantifiable. It’ll make creating quantity takeoffs a breeze.

# June Webinars: 3D BIM, GDTF, and Water Efficiency

Maintain accreditation and earn continuing education credits with Vectorworks’ monthly webinars. Whether you are a beginner or experienced designer, you can gain new skills, fine-tune workflows, and discover all you can do with Vectorworks.

Transitioning to 3D BIM Software 

_Aired on June 14_

With project schedules becoming increasingly more compressed, you may be looking for a new workflow that’s efficient, but also doesn’t hinder your creative process. One of the most straightforward ways to make a change in your building design process is by adopting a 3D modeling workflow. Incorporating this method will help you remain creative and meet shorter deadlines.

This presentation includes a brief history of how you document your designs and compares the similarities and differences between a traditional, 2D workflow with a modern, 3D modeling workflow.

This course is approved for one AIA LU, AIBC, and AAA.

###### Integrating Design Technology for Water Efficient Landscapes

_Aired on June 23_

Designing landscapes with sustainability in mind is no longer a matter of preference but one of meeting jurisdictional requirements. Site designers are increasingly leaning on design software and online resources to make their current design workflows easier, and also to help meet the new obligations in water-efficient site design. By incorporating the water needs of proposed plants, designing hydrozones for irrigation and calculating water budgets, design applications help you to plan for beautiful landscapes that maximize water efficiency.

This course is approved for one LA CES HSW PDH and one APLD CEU.

# Practical Vectorworks Tips: What's This? Command

What’s this?

No, that’s the name of the feature. It’s the **What’s This?** command!

Beginners and experienced Vectorworks customers alike benefit from the **What’s This?** command. Vectorworks is a robust software with tools for hundreds of different tasks — odds are you aren’t familiar with every tool the software has to offer. The **What’s This?** command provides a convenient way to discover the use of those unknown tools that’ve piqued your interest.

###### **Using the What’s This? Command**

You’ll find the command under the Help menu at the very top of your screen. The command is the second option in the drop-down menu.

When you activate the command, you’ll see a small question mark appear next to your cursor. This indicates that the command is active.

Next, click on an icon or menu that has you curious. A web browser will open directly to the Vectorworks Help entry for the interface item you clicked.

###### **Using Vectorworks Online Help**

If you use the **What’s This?** command on the **Reshape** tool in the basic tool palette, for example, this is what you’ll see:

The Help page gives you a rundown of what the tool does as well as descriptions of its modes. Many of the Help pages also have embedded YouTube videos so you can see the feature in action.

The Help system has entries for everything in Vectorworks as well as some pages that outline standard workflows in the software. If you have a question about using Vectorworks, the Help system’s encyclopedic knowledge-base is a good first place to check.

And that’s all there is to the **What’s This?** command. It’s not as extravagant as other Vectorworks features, but it’s a good one to keep in your back pocket, whether you’re just getting started with Vectorworks or if you’re an experienced designer looking to take your process to a new level.

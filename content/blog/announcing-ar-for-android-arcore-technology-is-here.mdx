# Announcing AR for Android: ARCore Technology is Here

Our Vectorworks Nomad mobile app now offers ARCore support on Android devices, thanks to Google’s [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar/) technology. As of today, you can build new AR experiences that seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds, enhancing how you can approach planning and presentation.

“With the addition of Augmented Reality for the Android platform, [Vectorworks Service Select](https://serviceselect.vectorworks.net/login%5Fform?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fcontent=arcore020419&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext) members with Android devices are now able to visualize their designs from Vectorworks 3D files in a new and compelling way,” said Vectorworks Mobile Team Manager Alex Nicol. “This new viewer will help designers convey design intent by rendering a virtual design in the real-world environment, at real-world scale.”

# A&A Launches Vectorworks 2018 in Japan with Successful Event

Our Japanese distributor, [A&A Co. Ltd.](http://www.aanda.co.jp/), recently hosted an event to introduce Vectorworks 2018 to designers in Japan. [Vectorworks Live](http://www.aanda.co.jp/Event/VectorworksLive/) was held on December 1 in Tokyo. The event had 360 people in attendance, and an additional 1,500 tuned in to the live stream through Facebook Live and YouTube Live.

“It was our pleasure to communicate to our customers what they can expect in the future of Vectorworks and give them confidence as they continue to design with the software,” said Takashi Yokota, president of A&A Co., Ltd. “We introduced the new version, with the highly anticipated multi-view capability, and demonstrated each of the Design Series products — Architect, Landmark, and Spotlight. We also provided attendees insight into the future direction of development of Vectorworks.”

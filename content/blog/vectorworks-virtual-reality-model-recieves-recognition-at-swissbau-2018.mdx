# Vectorworks Virtual Reality Model Receives Recognition at Swissbau 2018

BIM and virtual reality were the center of attention recently at [Swissbau](https://www.swissbau.ch/), Switzerland’s biggest building tradeshow. This year’s event included lectures, exhibits, and an [Innovation Lab](https://www.swissbau.ch/en-US/innovation-lab/ueber-innovation-lab.aspx) focused on new opportunities through digital transformation, with demonstrations related to the future of design. Our distributor [ComputerWorks](https://www.computerworks.ch/software.html) played an integral role in this interactive and educational show. 

The ComputerWorks team had [a booth presence](https://www.computerworks.ch/vectorworks-blog/details/viele-besucher-an-der-swissbau-2018.html) in the expo hall at Swissbau, where more than 3,500 visitors stopped by to learn about [Vectorworks](http://www.vectorworks.net/bim?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=swissbau02092018) software, talk to architects currently implementing BIM projects with Vectorworks, and explore BIM models through virtual reality. 

The team also participated in the Swissbau Innovation Lab. The main attraction within the lab was the iRoom, where participants were fully immersed in virtual reality experiences.

In the iRoom, a 3D model of the Federal Palace of Switzerland, created with Vectorworks Architect by Itten + Brechbühl AG, was used to demonstrate how new technologies can solve common design problems. The model served as an example of how buildings will be planned, built, used, and operated in the future.

Federal Councillor Ueli Maurer attended the opening of the tradeshow. After cutting the ribbon to mark the opening of the event, he took a tour of the show and eventually made his way to the iRoom where he immersed himself in the model of the Federal Palace with 3D glasses.

"As far as I could see, Ueli Maurer was impressed by the Innovation Lab and the potential of digitization," said Rudolf Pfander, Swissbau's trade fair manager, who accompanied the tour.

The sample model of the Federal Palace was featured in [the Swiss newspaper _20 Minutes_](http://www.20min.ch/schweiz/news/story/So-koennte-das-neue-Bundeshaus-aussehen-26728302), and the Swissbau event (including the Vectorworks model) was covered by Swiss [TV station SRF](https://tp.srgssr.ch/p/portal?urn=urn:srf:ais:video:bc12ba15-68be-4ded-bc85-e519235ec2d0&autoplay=true&legacy=true&width=640&height=360&playerType=).

# Teaser Tuesday: VGM Level of Detail

This #TeaserTuesday, we’re teasing an update to the Vectorworks Graphics Module (VGM) that will make Vectorworks 2020 run much smoother than previous versions.

The VGM affects how Vectorworks generates and presents 2D and 3D geometry. In version 2019, loading tons of geometry could slow down your computer, especially on larger projects. Users occasionally reported slow frame rates when panning or zooming, and often loading files could take longer than anticipated.

The update for 2020 addresses these issues. The software will seem more realistic — as you zoom out, you’ll notice less and less detail on geometry, mimicking the way the human eye operates. As you zoom back in, geometry will load with its customary high level of detail.

This occurs at a micro level, unseen to the user — we generate geometry in Vectorworks with tessellation/triangulation, wherein the software generates more vertices to show higher levels of detail. The 2020 update means Vectorworks won’t load unnecessary vertices as the object moves farther from the virtual camera — which, for larger projects, can easily cut memory use in half.

And when Vectorworks runs smoother, your designs can become reality even sooner.

###### Improving Accuracy and Efficiency for Pre-Production 

_Aired July 12_

Typically, we offer you webinars monthly via our learning management system, [Vectorworks University](https://university.vectorworks.net/). This month, however, we’re excited to share that we’ll be sponsoring an entertainment webinar with [Avixa](https://www.avixa.org/)!

This webinar, hosted by Eric Girard, senior technical director at [Cramer](https://www.cramer.com), will focus on boosting the accuracy and efficiency of your live event design process. Girard will showcase how he creates wiring and video flows with [ConnectCAD](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/connectcad). He’ll also discuss the challenges he normally faces and why it’s so important to have a design software.

###### Design Technology’s Role in Environmental Stewardship

_Aired July 21_

If you’re a landscape designer, you’re likely looking for new ways to integrate sustainable objectives into your site design workflow. These objectives can stem from a conscientious client, a jurisdictional mandate, or a desire to create a positive environmental impact beyond each project site.

Fortunately, technology is more capable than ever to support your sustainability objectives. This presentation will showcase various firms’ successes found in using their design software and other technology integrations to achieve their goals for environmental stewardship. It will also explore opportunities where technology can continue to develop for better landscape performance.

This course is also approved for one LA CES HSW PDH and one APLD CEU.

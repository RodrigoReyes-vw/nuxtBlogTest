# RENDER'S GAME: VECTORWORKS PARTNERS WITH AIAS FOR DESIGN COMPETITION

For the second year, we are celebrating the next generation of designers through our partnership with the [American Institute of Architecture Students (AIAS)](http://www.aias.org/). Together, we are sponsoring the second annual AIAS [In Studio Render/Sketch Competition](http://www.aias.org/competitions/studio-render-sketch-competition/).

AIAS is asking its members to share their sketches and renderings to showcase their work and inspire those looking to grow their skill sets.

"AIAS members like to live on the edge of design, technology, and innovation,” said Nick Serfass, executive director of the AIAS. “As the next generation of architects, the AIAS is excited to partner with Vectorworks, a next-generation technology company. Vectorworks' products and technology can help propel AIAS members to the forefront of the design and architecture professions."

The deadline for AIAS members to enter the competition is December 14\. Participants should share their sketches and/or renderings on their public Instagram and tag AIAS (@aiasorg) and Vectorworks (@vectorworks), and use the hashtags #AIASInStudio and #InStudioRender.

Every Wednesday throughout the competition, AIAS National Officers will select their top five submissions and feature them in the AIAS InStudio Highlights on Instagram.

At the end of the competition, the jury will select three winners from posted submissions. The first-place winner will receive a cash prize of $300, with second- and third-place winners taking home $200 and $100, respectively. For inspiration, take a look at last year’s winning entries [here](http://www.aias.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/InStudio-Render-Sketch-Comp%5FWinners.pdf).

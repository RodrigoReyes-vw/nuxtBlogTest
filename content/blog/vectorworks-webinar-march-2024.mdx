#### The Data Difference: 3D for Landscape Analysis

_Aired March 21 | Approved for one APLD CEU and LA CES CEU_

Though 3D-modeled landscapes are becoming more common in design workflows, many still hesitate to involve valuable techniques in all areas of their design workflow.  
  
A key benefit to incorporating 3D and BIM in your landscape design, beyond selling, is analysis. In this session, you'll learn how to leverage the power of solar, terrain, building, and landscape feature modeling to better analyze site conditions, advise clients, and validate design choices.  
  
By integrating 3D with 2D design workflows, there's less disruption in getting to a sellable, better-performing solution for your clients.

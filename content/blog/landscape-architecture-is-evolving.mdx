# Landscape Architecture Is Evolving

The landscape architecture industry, as it moves to standardize BIM workflows, is experiencing a transition not unlike moving from hand drawings to CAD drafting.

Our Landscape Product Marketing Manager, Eric Gilbey, PLA, ASLA, presented at the [2019 Digital Landscape Architecture Conference (DLA)](https://www.dla-conference.com/) on how BIM workflows benefit landscape architects. His takeaways speak to the industry’s ongoing evolution. 

“Many landscape architects made the switch from hand drawing to CAD drafting as a matter of necessity. We needed tools that allowed us to collaborate easiest,” he said. “It’s been a similar process with adopting BIM.”

BIM lets landscape architects work more closely with architects, engineers, and other external collaborators — many of whom use BIM regularly — on projects with structural and civil requirements. “Architects and engineers have come to expect these BIM workflows,” Gilbey said. “Even for just the benefit of making better site design decisions, it’s a better workflow, anyway.”

Adopting a new workflow, however, isn't always a walk in the park.

For one, not all landscape-specific software options are capable of doing BIM, and not all BIM software options are purpose-built for the landscape architect, Gilbey said. Landscape architects often use an array of different software programs to append data to their models. Then, there’s the learning curve: It takes time to successfully implement BIM workflows, time at the cost of project efficiency. Moreover, what are firms to do with old software containing completed projects?

For Gilbey, Vectorworks Landmark is the solution.

###### BIM in Landmark

While much of the landscape architecture software out there hasn’t wholly integrated BIM workflows, _Vectorworks Landmark has._

Data is crucial to design. That’s why Landmark lets you inform design decisions with live data visualization, such as slope analysis, water budgets, solar animations, and more.

All the data is in one, easy-to-access interface. You won’t have to slow your design process to scour spreadsheets. ![Bim_for_Land](https://blog.vectorworks.net/hs-fs/hubfs/190627_BIMforLandscape/Bim_for_Land.jpg?width=1440&name=Bim_for_Land.jpg)

###### Learning Resources

Check out free resources on our [support page](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/support?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=BIMforLandscape062719) and our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/vectorworks), where you’ll find videos and tutorials on implementing BIM for landscape architecture.

###### Maintaining Projects

Whether importing, referencing, or exporting, Landmark supports the need landscape architects have to work with .dwg files, so AutoCAD projects need not be left behind — you can watch our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06qSABUm4wo) on importing .dwg files and performing intelligent site analysis, a process essential to design. 

Gilbey also developed a guide for adopting landscape BIM, which you can find [here](http://fliphtml5.com/kgve/htqa/basic) for free.

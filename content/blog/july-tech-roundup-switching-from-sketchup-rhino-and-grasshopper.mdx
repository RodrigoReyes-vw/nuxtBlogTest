# July Tech Roundup: Switching from SketchUp, Rhino, and Grasshopper

Did you recently switch to Vectorworks from another software and are now wondering where to begin? Look no further. Check out these in-depth courses from [Vectorworks University](https://university.vectorworks.net/?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=072420techroundup) for the best places to start your new workflow journey and to see the benefits now that you've switched.

## Switching from SketchUp and Rhino

If you previously used SketchUp, this tutorial will walk you through creating a massing model using the various solid modeling tools in combination with the 2D shapes available in Vectorworks.

When creating a 3D model, there is always more than one way to achieve the same result, however, this tutorial will show you a recommended path so you can understand behaviors specific to the tools and commands.

[![Switching From Sketchup? Get Started](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/3018241/f8ba5744-dd14-4994-885f-9453838bd98a.png)](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/3018241/f8ba5744-dd14-4994-885f-9453838bd98a) 

Similarly, with Rhino, once you finish this course, you’ll have a better understanding of the BIM and 3D modeling capabilities available to you. You’ll see how using one program — for both modeling and documenting your projects — saves time, reduces errors, and increases productivity.

Also, get a first-hand look at the benefits of switching from Rhino that include editing parametrically, viewports, intelligent objects, and more.

## Switching from Grasshopper

Many architects use Grasshopper to build parametric geometry. In this tutorial, get to know [Marionette](https://www.vectorworks.net/training/marionette?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=072420techroundup) — the graphical-scripting feature that is fully integrated with Vectorworks. Learn the advantages of using Marionette as a graphical scripting tool including:

* Native interface.
* Creating plug-in objects.
* Creating menu commands.
* Analysis capabilities.
* Python scripting.

# Marionette Monday: Save Time on Stories, Levels, and Layers

Imagine designing a 50-floor skyscraper. You’d need to replicate the height for all 50 stories — a daunting task that is sure to take hundreds of clicks.

Say hello to greater efficiency with this new [Marionette](https://www.vectorworks.net/training/marionette?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=marionettemonday102819) script. Marionette, Vectorworks’ built-in algorithmic modeling tool, lets you automate file management and organization tasks as well as create multiple iterations of custom designs, so you can focus on the design itself instead of documentation.

This wrapper allows you to create stories, levels, and layers based on an overall building height, a typical floor height, and a first floor height. Create four Layer Levels and two Layerless Levels in just a few clicks. Simply leave some fields blank if you need fewer stories, or edit the script to add more stories.

We recommend running this script in a file without existing stories, levels, or story-associated layers to avoid interference with the creation of new stories.

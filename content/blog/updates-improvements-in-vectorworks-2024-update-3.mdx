Continue reading to learn what the latest update has in store for you and your designs.

#### For Landscape Architects & Designers

With the release of Vectorworks 2024 Update 3, you can look forward to including even more detail, data, and imagery in your designs, documents, and presentations in [Vectorworks Landmark](https://www.vectorworks.net/landmark?utm%5Fmedium=pr&utm%5Fsource=coverage&utm%5Fcontent=vectorworks-2024-update-3).

The new **[PlantMaster plugin](https://plantmaster.com/)** grants those with an active PlantMaster subscription the ability to use their vast library for detailed plant reports and visually stunning representations.

The plugin from the [Vectorworks Partner Network member](https://www.vectorworks.net/community/partner-network?utm%5Fmedium=pr&utm%5Fsource=coverage&utm%5Fcontent=vectorworks-2024-update-3) can be easily installed by accessing the “Install Partner Products” palette inside Vectorworks.

Additionally, the optimized DWG export for **Landscape Area objects** helps you exchange DWG files while ensuring accuracy and precision.

#### For Architects

To cater to your distinct needs as an architect, Vectorworks 2024 Update 3 includes better support of corner windows with defined wall closures for more accurate BIM models.

The **Callout tool** has also been enhanced to work with rotated plans. It allows you to annotate plan drawings intuitively and accurately.

#### For Lighting & Live Event Designers

Significant developments to the My Virtual Rig (MVR) import and export function deliver better support for **Project Sharing**, Gobo images, Seating Sections, and other data such as shutter information, color name, and fixture position, so you can easily exchange higher-quality files. [The General Device Type Format](https://gdtf-share.com/) (GDTF) import function has also undergone advancements, allowing easier access to fixtures and their data.

With Vectorworks 2024 Update 3, [rigging experts using Braceworks](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/brace-yourself-3-tips-on-starting-in-braceworks.html) can expect improvements in generating reports. Braceworks reports are now even more consistent and readable with a higher visual quality.

You’ll also find a performance boost when working with truss objects. Inserting truss objects in files with multiple light objects and other complex geometry is faster and provides a much smoother modeling experience.

#### For All Designers

Regardless of your design discipline, Vectorworks 2024 Update 3 offers support for dimension-type data fields in the **Title Block Border**. This improvement gives you greater flexibility in reporting project information in the title block. Plus, adding import/export support for Revit 2024 files improves the file exchange process with collaborators using the most current version of Revit.

#### How to Install the Update

This update is available to download for all currently released English-based versions of Vectorworks 2024\. To install the update, select **Check for Updates** from the **Vectorworks** menu (Mac) or the **Help** menu (Windows).

At Vectorworks, [providing you with a host of resources and services](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/what-can-design-students-get-from-vectorworks.html) isn't all we do to support the beginning of your design journey.

Each year, we award young designers scholarships for projects in the architecture, interior design, landscape, and entertainment industries. And, after over 1,000 submissions, we're so very excited to announce this year's winners of the [2022 Design Scholarship!](https://www.vectorworks.net/scholarship/winners)

Congrats to all of the winners, and we can't wait to see all of the wonderful work you'll do for years to come!

## Michelle wanitzek's "Nomad coworking" project

Taking home this year's coveted Richard Diehl Award, our grand prize, is Michelle Wanitzek for her project, "Nomad Coworking."

The winning project, which was submitted by Wanitzek for her master's thesis at Fakultät Gestaltung Wismar, features a coworking space and coffeeshop in a listed monument — a site identified for its architectural or historical significance — and focuses on the increasing importance of alternative and flexible workspaces. The design tackled a challenging task — working with a historical monument's intricacies and structural limits while simultaneously preserving the protected façade and showcasing the transformation for experiential value.

“With a progressive idea of what monument protection means, Michelle designed an infrastructure in the middle of Wismar’s Old Town, which is suitable to revitalize the city and capable of giving the monument a contemporary purpose,” said the [University of Wismar](https://www.hs-wismar.de/) Dean of the Faculty of Design Prof. Dipl.-Ing. Oliver Hantke, judging panel member. “Her concept of multi-layered use picks up on current trends in the construction industry including sustainability and efficiency strategy, utilizing historical buildings, revitalizing small-town structures, new forms of working environments, and providing communication structures to strengthen social cohesion.”

“It is a great honor to win the Richard Diehl Award with my thesis project, especially because I never expected this success,” said Wanitzek. “It means a lot to me to show that interior design is much more than most people realize. It’s about how we want to live and how we can utilize the architecture that already surrounds us. I think in today’s world, there should be an increased focus on repurposing existing buildings and I hope this award will increase awareness of the practice.”

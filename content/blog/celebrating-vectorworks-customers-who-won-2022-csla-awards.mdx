The Canadian Society of Landscape Architects (CSLA) gave out awards to 15 projects across the nation, with a Jury’s Award of Excellence also going to one project.

When the CSLA announced the winners, they also shared the following criteria, which a five-person jury used to select recipients:

* Demonstration of a deep understanding of the craft of landscape architecture and attention to composition and detail
* Demonstration of excellence in leadership, project management, breadth of work, new directions, or new technology
* Innovation in concept, process, materials, or implementation
* Promotion of the discipline amongst related professions, clients, and the general public
* Demonstration of exemplary environmental and/or social awareness

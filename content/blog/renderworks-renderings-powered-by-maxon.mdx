# Your Guide to Rendering with Renderworks

Looking for a great way to present your newest design to a client or stakeholder? Renderings can really make a project come to life.

Multiple world-class rendering options are at your disposal as plug-ins available in Vectorworks, such as [Enscape](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/your-guide-to-real-time-rendering-with-enscape.html), [Lumion](https://lumion.com/), and [Twinmotion](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/your-guide-to-rendering-with-twinmotion.html). Renderworks rendering options — on the other hand — exist natively in Vectorworks.

In this post, we’ll be discussing Renderworks, which is powered by Nemetschek sister company [Maxon](https://www.maxon.net/), the innovators behind a range of visualization technology.

But before we dive into Renderworks, let’s review why renderings can be so important to your design process.

## Why Create Renderings?

Some designers shy away from rendering because it’s an additional step in the process, one that uses computer resources and time to accomplish.

But the benefits of producing a rendering far outweigh the time costs, and here’s why:

* Clients sometimes aren’t specialized enough to faithfully interpret drawings, plans, or models. A fully visualized space is easier for clients to understand and ultimately approve.
* Clients often appreciate the ability to visualize the project before it’s built, not unlike how you’d want to test drive a car before committing to the purchase.
* A rendering can help visualize and quality check a material selection.

So, by including renderings in your presentation packages, you’re ultimately helping guide consultants and clients through a smoother review and approval process, which can lead to savings in time and money for all parties. With this in mind, additional steps and computer resources no longer seem like such a hindrance.

Renderworks is sure to let you capitalize on all the advantages that come with fully visualized projects.

## Renderworks for Renderings

Renderworks, powered by Cineware by Maxon, is your built-in rendering tool in Vectorworks. The robust technology allows you to create photorealistic renderings that are bound to impress.

Renderworks amplifies the visual effect of your design with features like lighting, reflections, volumetric effects, camera effects, and anti-aliasing. But the true highlight of Renderworks is ray tracing, which creates precise calculations of light and shadow.

As you can see from the image below, ray tracing’s calculations result in some of the most realistic and dynamic renderings natively available in a design software.

## Redshift for Renderings

With the launch of [Vectorworks 2022](https://www.vectorworks.net/2022), Redshift by Maxon has been added to your Renderworks tool belt. When speaking on the integration, Paul Babb, Maxon chief marketing officer said, "We're thrilled to make both Redshift and a connection to the Cinema 4D ecosystem available to Vectorworks customers via our Cineware exchange.”

Redshift speeds up your rendering process within Vectorworks by relying on the graphics processing unit (GPU), which _estimates_ light, unlike ray tracing.

And with the recent release [Vectorworks 2022 Service Pack 1](https://www.vectorworks.net/downloads/notes/2022SP1%5FNotes), Redshift renderings can be processed in the Vectorworks Cloud! This means that you can now use the Redshift rendering styles even if you don’t have the minimum hardware required to run Redshift natively.

## Maxon, Vectorworks Platinum Partner

Not only is Maxon a Nemetschek sister company, but it’s also a Platinum member of the [Vectorworks Partner Network](https://www.vectorworks.net/community/partner-network).

Our Partner Network of innovators like Maxon supports the creativity designers like you. Together, we bring new opportunities, expand audiences, and help our shared customers, all in the name of great design.

# Roundup: Women Moving Architecture Forward

In honor of [Jeanne Gang](http://studiogang.com/people/jeanne-gang) recently being named on the [TIME 100 list](https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2019/5567842/jeanne-gang/), we wanted to highlight some more of our favorite women who are crushing it in the architecture industry.

###### Kimberly A. Dwyer at [Dwyer Architectural](https://www.dwyerarch.com/)

As managing partner and founder of the firm, Dwyer strongly advocated to be a part of the New York State Minority and Women Business Development program, leading to its WBE certification. The firm’s designs in the healthcare, medical research, and higher education fields have made a mark in the architecture industry under Dwyer’s leadership.

> _**"Being the new kid on the block, it was one way to get our firm looked at in a different way than our competitors. The certification continues to allow us opportunities including teaming with national firms that has offered us continued growth."**_

###### Lizzie Hinton at [bpr architects](https://bprarchitects.com/)

For over five years, this architect has been leading design projects for bpr, working in a variety of sectors for the firm with an intelligent approach to designing for clients. Structured around an employee ownership model, the UK-based firm shares a percentage of profits with everyone involved in the business, meaning everyone, including Hinton, is a partner.

> _**"You can see a building in context, see what it is happening, all its surroundings. Probably in more detail than in back in the day. So, you're not just thinking of the building by itself. At the same time, it must meet strategic needs. Think about the impact of what you are doing."**_

###### Karen Lewis at [The M Group Architects + Interior Architects](https://www.mgrouparchitects.com/)

Lewis is a partner and interior designer who is responsible for programming, design development, furniture coordination, construction administration and oversight of construction document production at the firm. As a champion for collaboration and socialization in the workplace, she enjoys meeting the unique challenge of making office spaces functional but adjustable.

> **_"I love my career and I’m passionate about space that hopefully is for the betterment of people when they go to their work environment and I hope to pass that on to the next generation."_**

#### All Designers

* Vectorworks 2024 delivers an updated UI that saves you time and allows for easier customization.
* The redesigned **View** and **Mode** bars bring a wide range of tools to the forefront for easy access.
* You can save custom viewport settings as "styles" for easy transferability.
* The new ability for bi-directional data reference from Excel files enhances collaborative data capabilities.
* Improvements to **Shaded Rendering** allow you to assess your designs more confidently with improvements to shadow casting and the addition of camera settings that allow you to define depth of field, exposure, and bloom for real-world camera-like effects.
* Project Sharing in Vectorworks Design Suite products has been rebuilt to ensure project data and geometry is always current. **Project Sharing+** tracks every change, every time, and substantially improves reliability regardless of team or project size.

#### Architects and Interior Designers

* Threshold and sill geometry has been improved to accurately fit with wall closures and and to contain more options to control interior and exterior conditions.
* Door handing standardization allows for more accurate geometry and data.
* Materials can be assigned to door and window objects for greater graphic control.
* Parametric handrails and guardrails can be created from other building objects, such as stairs, slabs, and ramps, granting the flexibility to create more custom configurations.
* New parametric cabinet objects for interiors projects enable greater customization and more interactive placement.

#### Landscape Architects and Designers

* We’ve introduced a new, automated **Fence** tool, allowing the following in 2D and 3D:  
    
   * Integrated posts, gates, and terrain options like sloped or stepped.  
   * Accurate material reporting for documentation purposes.

#### Lighting and Live Event Designers

* A new **Equipment Lists** feature provides automated solutions to the complex task of unifying equipment and inventory tracking. It streamlines the preproduction process by planning and documenting all necessary equipment for a show or production.
* The ConnectCAD Share Reports command allows designers to upload design data to [Vectorworks Cloud Services](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/cloud-services), ensuring that project partners and installers have access to the most up-to-date information. These reports are viewable on any device.

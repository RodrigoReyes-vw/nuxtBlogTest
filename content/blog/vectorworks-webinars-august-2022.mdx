# August Webinars: Net-Zero Landscapes, AV Workflows, & Model Validation

Maintain accreditation and earn continuing education credits with Vectorworks’ monthly webinars. Whether you're a beginner or experienced designer, you can gain new skills, fine-tune workflows, and discover all you can do with Vectorworks.

## Net-Zero Water Stormwater Landscapes

_Aired August 18_

[“Green infrastructure”](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/different-ways-to-practice-green-infrastructure.html) can be a broad term. But when applied to stormwater, it represents a way to help achieve your net-zero landscape goals. Rain gardens, conservation landscapes, and tree plantings of appropriate species can be paired with designing for the water that’s present in your site. Water harvesting can also be added for a source of supplemental water, and green roofs can be your first line of defense when it comes to achieving net-zero water on your site.

This course is also approved for one LA CES HSW PDH and one APLD CEU.

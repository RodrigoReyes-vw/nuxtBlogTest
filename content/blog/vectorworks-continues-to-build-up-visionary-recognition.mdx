# Vectorworks Continues to BUILD Up Visionary Recognition

This month, the “V” in Vectorworks stands for visionary. Why? We’ve been named a winner of [BUILD magazine’s](https://www.build-review.com/) Visionaries in Technology award. This inaugural award program was launched with a focus on companies that are shaping the future of technology for construction and architecture sectors and continue to innovate and develop new techniques to keep both sectors moving forward.

This award was judged by the BUILD in-house research team, and all potential winners were assessed with multiple, relevant criteria, including previous accolades won; company performance over a specified period of time; influence within the industry, sector, or region; and client testimonials or recommendations. 

“[Vectorworks Architect](http://www.vectorworks.net/architect?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=visionariesaward103017) was on our research team’s radar before the award process began. Throughout the process, we were highly impressed by the dedication to practical usability and the focus on translating architectural concepts into workable project files without compromising design freedom,” said Daniel Hornsby, head of features at BUILD magazine. “The BUILD team felt that the Vectorworks full product suite displayed exactly the kind of intuitive, user-focused design that we wanted to celebrate with this award.” 

Another focus of the award is the ongoing modernization and digitation of the architecture and construction sectors. With BIM rapidly becoming an industry staple, a key part of the award’s mission was looking at the firms pushing the leading edge of this wave of innovation, and as noted by Hornsby, “Vectorworks’ programs are clear front-runners in the category.” 

As part of winning the award, Vectorworks will be featured in BUILD magazine’s January 2018 issue. To learn more about this award or other BUILD magazine awards, check out our press release.

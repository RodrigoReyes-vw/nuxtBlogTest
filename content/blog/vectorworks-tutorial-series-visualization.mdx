# Vectorworks Tutorial Series | Visualization

Visualization is a truly exciting part of any designer's process.

Whether you're creating beautiful renderings, using data visualization to document all your project's important details, or 3D printing, visualization helps you and your consultants see your designs in a more realistic, helpful way. 

If you’re looking for some awesome resources about visualization in Vectorworks, look no further than _Planet Vectorworks._ Once you're done reading this tutorial series, check out some of the posts below.

In this post, you’ll see some training videos on various visualization features available with Vectorworks, like:

* Visualizing data
* Rendering with Twinmotion
* 3D printing

## Visualizing Important Project Data

Visualizing data can turn a good model into a great one by graphically displaying information.

This quick video will walk you through how to visualize project data in Vectorworks. See step-by-step how to apply graphical attributes to a model to represent conditions like fire rating and load bearing status, or any property you might need for a project.

## Using Vectorworks and Twinmotion

In this webinar, Jonathan Reeves of Jonathan Reeves Architects shows you how easy it is to upgrade your presentations with graphically rich renderings and animations via Twinmotion. You’ll also see how to refine textures and lighting to produce photorealistic renderings, then get a crash course in how to share renderings, animations, and interactive presentations with stakeholders.

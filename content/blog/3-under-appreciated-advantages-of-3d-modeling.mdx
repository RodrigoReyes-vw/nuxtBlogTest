# Maximizing 3D Modeling: Beyond Sales & Presentation

There’s a common misconception that 3D modeling should only be used for selling projects or showcasing final design visions, and it’s often seen as an extra cost for clients. In this article, you’ll see why 3D modeling in Vectorworks Landmark has potential far beyond sales and presentation, why it’s easier than you might think, and how the benefits pay off in droves.

#### The Lesser-Known Advantages of 3D Modeling

3D modeling allows you to tell a holistic story about your design through its geometry and parameters. Moreover, using 3D geometry in Vectorworks enables intelligent workflows that vastly improve your ability to harvest data and analyze your project.

Let’s discuss a few ways in which these factors improve your landscape workflows.

###### Enhanced Data Management

Parametric/smart hybrid objects offer even more benefits by providing parameter information in reports, allowing for revisions based on analysis, and appending data as needed.

These intelligent objects streamline the design process by facilitating quick adjustments and updates, so you can quickly and easily ensure that the final product aligns with the client's vision and requirements.

Additionally, the ability to extract detailed data from these objects enhances project documentation and communication, fostering a collaborative and transparent workflow. Embracing these advanced tools elevates the design process, empowering you to work efficiently and make more informed design decisions.

###### Sun/Shade Analysis

Conducting sun/shade analysis can contribute to energy efficiency, plant suitability, meeting client preferences, and supporting artistic/design treatments. This analysis can inform decisions on plant selection, placement of structures, and overall layout to ensure that the design meets the client's needs and enhances the overall aesthetic and functionality of the site.

Simply put, you couldn’t conduct sun/shade analysis with 2D drawings. You conduct sun/shade studies in Vectorworks with the **Heliodon** tool, located in the Visualization toolset. You can find a free webinar later in this post that explores the various ways in which you can use the **Heliodon** tool to your advantage.

###### Scalability of 3D Modeling

As you complete more and more projects with 3D, you’ll be able to amass a library of intelligent objects in your Vectorworks **Resource Manager**. Whether these objects are plants, hardscape materials, or detail specifications, as time goes on, you’ll be able to insert these objects very quickly into new projects, saving you from having to remodel something you completed on a previous project.

In this way, learning 3D modeling is a fantastic investment to make, because it pays off enormously in saved time, especially when you consider the other benefits of 3D modeling discussed in this post.

#### Take the Next Steps in Your 3D Modeling Journey Today

3D modeling offers a multitude of advantages beyond just sales and presentation. From conveying design narratives to enhancing data management and scalability, the benefits of incorporating 3D modeling into your workflow are undeniable. By investing in learning 3D modeling, you save time and improve efficiency, and you also elevate the quality and accuracy of your designs.

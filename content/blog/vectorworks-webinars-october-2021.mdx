###### Landscape | Dynamic Efficiency for Design Build

_Thursday, October 21 | 2 pm EST_

If you’re designing and building with a team, dynamic collaboration and workflow efficiency are vital to the success of the project. Join us as we explore how to achieve dynamic efficiency from concept to field. Using real-world projects and examples from their team on the ground in Colorado, Cheri Stringer of 10x award-winning TLC Gardens Design Build Firm will walk you through integrating graphics, applying detail, and utilizing sheet sets for construction implementation. Together we’ll tackle best practices for creating a project portfolio and analyze strategies for effective team execution with Vectorworks sheet sets, graphics, and 3D model visualizations.

###### Architecture | Model Validation and Collaboration Process for BIM

_Tuesday, October 26 | 2 pm EST_

Model validation and coordination are a huge benefit of a BIM workflow. And such processes are becoming even more efficient, thanks to the construction industry rapidly adopting new technologies for better integrated project delivery. In this webinar, we’ll discuss the BIM adoption strategies used by Studio Partington, as well as how new technologies helped them provide better quality models for collaboration in their Open BIM process.

Vectorworks’ partnership with its Nemetschek sister company, Solibri, brings Vectorworks Architect users a new [Solibri Direct](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/solibri-direct-feature-vectorworks-open-bim.html) connection. Discover how Solibri office can help you create more reliable and accurate models for validation, checking, and coordination.

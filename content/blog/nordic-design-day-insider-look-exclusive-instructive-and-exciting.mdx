# Nordic Design Day Insider Look: Exclusive, Instructive, and Exciting

Nordic Design Day came to Copenhagen, Denmark on November 10 with the goal of presenting attendees from the AEC, landscape, interior, and entertainment industries with the latest in 3D design and rendering. Designers from Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, and Denmark gathered at the [Danish Architecture Center](https://dac.dk/en) to learn about the powerful new features in [Vectorworks 2018](http://www.vectorworks.net/en/2018?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=nddrecap112017) from our CEO, Dr. Biplab Sarkar, and how to use Vectorworks software for maximum work efficiency.

“Vectorworks Nordic Design Day in Copenhagen on November 10th was acclaimed by the audience as a great selection of presenting users showing some of the many ways you can create unique design with Vectorworks,” says John Hansen, founder and partner of MikroGraf and Vectorworks’ distributor in Denmark. “Breaks were busy exchanging experience and ideas, and the catering blended everything in an excellent way through the finishing happy hour.”

Between presentations attendees had opportunities to share their thoughts and ideas during a networking lunch, coffee breaks, and a happy hour at the end of the event. Several users praised this open environment to engage in discussion and appreciated the chance to engage with top designers.

“Just wanted to give a big thank you for the day in Copenhagen and because you invited such inspirational lecturers,” says Göran Skoog, architect SAR/MSA and CEO of Arkitekt Göran Skoog Ab. “It was valuable for me to get an impression of, for example, Jesper Thyge Brøgger, whom I also shared lunch with. Then I met several other interesting people, like Toto Verwers. It was wonderful to be at the Danish Architecture Center with a beautiful lunch!”

Based on feedback from attendees of the last Nordic Design Day, this year’s event largely focused on moving from 2D to 3D, as well as how to present projects through advanced rendering features. The wide range of presentations showed attendees how they can use Vectorworks for a variety of different projects, such as a method to create visualizations and a way to streamline modeling.

3Dconnexion Benelux donated a [SpaceMouse Wireless Kit](https://www.3dconnexion.eu/products/spacemouse.html?%5Fs=gqamvocqv8eiplv8mr4a3n99g3) for a raffle drawing among attendees. Luis Ruiz, senior product specialist at Vectorworks, Inc., demonstrated how the 3Dconnexion SpaceNavigator combined with Vectorworks gives designers the flexibility and versatility they need to help transform an idea into a digital 3D form. 

When using this device, both hands are engaged in a balanced and cooperative work style to increase productivity; one hand engages the SpaceNavigator to navigate the model, while the other hand is used to select, create, or edit the environment. Congratulations to [Ari Ignatius](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ari-ignatius-126b994/) from Finland who won the 3Dconnexion raffle. Ignatius is a long-time Vectorworks user and a freelance professional at [BakAri Consulting](http://bakari.fi/index.php?lang=en), a company that specializes in bakery and food industry investment projects.

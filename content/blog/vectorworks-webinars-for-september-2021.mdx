###### Entertainment | Powering Vectorworks' 3D Modeling with Parasolid

_Wednesday, September 22 | 2 pm EST_

Ever wonder about 3D modeling and the benefits it can provide for designers? Join Peter Kerwin, Parasolid product manager, and Mark Doubleday, stage lighting designer, in the latest webinar on 3D modeling with Vectorworks software. Kerwin will be discussing the importance of 3D modeling and the technology integrated into the Vectorworks 3D modeling engine. Doubleday will follow by describing some of the 3D modeling processes he used on a recent production of “Macbeath,” and how it helped him control reflected light from the glass and steel set.

###### Landscape | Enhance Collaboration with Georeferencing 

_Thursday, September 23 | 2 pm EST_

No matter who’s involved in your file exchange, it’s crucial to maintain accurate project file position and origin. This is essential for efficient design and documentation workflows — and the integrity of project delivery. This presentation will review best practice workflows using georeferencing within the file organization to integrate other CAD, BIM, and GIS files.

This course is approved for 1 LA CES PDH and 1 APLD CEU.

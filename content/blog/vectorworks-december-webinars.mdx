# December Webinars | Now Available on demand

As the year comes to an end, your design journey doesn’t need to.

Read on to learn more about our on-demand December webinars. Topics include Vectorworks Landmark and Esri, BIM collaboration, and rack and panel planning with ConnectCAD.

#### Vectorworks & Esri: A Powerful integration

_Aired December 6 | Approved for one APLD CEU_

The design and construction of built environments often require complex inputs across numerous stakeholders and disciplines. Shifts in scale require the translation of site analysis, design drivers, and principles. Advanced geospatial analysis tools and 3D geospatial data have the potential to facilitate design outcomes that are responsive to climate and context. However, communicating and integrating this data across disciplines can be a challenge.

[Enter Vectorworks Landmark and Esri](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/the-benefits-of-gis-workflows-with-esri.html).

This webinar explores the multidisciplinary design and planning of McGregor Coxall’s projects and workflows, demonstrating how integrated feedback loops between Vectorworks’ CAD/BIM process and Esri’s geospatial analysis can result in site-responsive and data-driven outcomes. It will also delve into how design concepts can feed back into the Esri platform to assess the best final project through quantitative scenario testing and how to communicate complex 2D and 3D outcomes to clients and stakeholders visually and interactively.

#### Demystifying BIM Collaboration

_Aired December 12 | Approved for one AIA LU_

Collaborating using a Building Information Model (BIM) can be done in a variety of ways, and there isn’t just one tool or one method available. These varied collaboration workflows depend on the needs of your project and the skill levels of your team members involved.

One key factor of BIM collaboration is the ability of each team member to use the software of choice that fits their tasks and can offer collaboration opportunities with others. To serve this, flexible design tools and open standards can provide ways to work with others while removing the need to use (or learn) unfamiliar software with limited, rigid workflow options.

This webinar demystifies the options for BIM collaboration so you can make an informed decision about the best method for your needs on any given project.

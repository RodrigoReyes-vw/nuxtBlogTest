# GDTF Becomes Entertainment Standard with DIN SPEC 15800

After its [two-year anniversary this past spring](/meet-the-open-data-format-that-will-change-the-entertainment-industry?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=060420gdtfdinspec), the [General Device Type Format (GDTF)](https://gdtf-share.com/) is delivering big news. Along with our fellow GDTF founders [MA Lighting](https://www.malighting.com/) and [Robe lighting](https://www.robe.cz/), we’re proud to announce that [DIN SPEC 15800](https://www.beuth.de/en/technical-rule/din-spec-15800/324748671) officially recognizes the GDTF as an open standard for the entertainment industry worldwide.

“With this latest accomplishment of DIN SPEC 15800, GDTF will continue its growth and see even greater success now that it is recognized as a standard way of communicating controllable characteristics of lighting fixtures,” said Vectorworks CEO Dr. Biplab Sarkar.

“GDTF has covered a lot of ground in the two short years since inception,” he continued. “We already have 35 manufacturers signed on to support the open standard and are grateful for their contributions to help build a solid basis for a standardized format that will advance the industry in new ways. I look forward to seeing more manufacturers, as well as more entertainment professionals contributing to the wide-spread availability of GDTF files and benefiting from it in their workflows.”

**What Is DIN SPEC?**

[DIN](https://www.din.de/en/innovation-and-research/din-spec-en), the German Institute for Standardization, is the independent platform for product and process standardization in Germany and worldwide.

A DIN SPEC is a document that specifies requirements for products, services, and/or processes. It’s also a trusted strategic instrument for quickly and easily establishing and disseminating innovative solutions on the market.

Basically, DIN's job is to ensure that a DIN SPEC does not conflict with any existing standards or rules of procedure.

**DIN SPEC for GDTF: A New Standard**

Now, GDTF will be a standard for describing the hierarchical and logical structure and controls of any type of controllable device in the lighting and entertainment industry.

GDTF will be used as a foundation for the exchange of device data between lighting consoles, as well as CAD and 3D pre-visualization applications.

The purpose of an existing GDTF file is to reflect the real-world physical components of the devices and to provide control based on this information. A GDTF file contains and is derived from the device’s real-world geometry, attributes, and abilities.

“DIN SPEC 15800 is a good example of what DIN wants to achieve with DIN SPECs: support those who improve the status-quo with an innovative idea,” said Michael Bahr, project manager at DIN. “GDTF can be one of those ideas for the entertainment industry. I'm happy that we could support this project and develop a standard with the GDTF group. In a short period of time, we were able to develop the document which will build trust in the GDTF format. DIN SPEC 15800 will make the GDTF format available and usable to everyone. That's what DIN SPEC is made for: ‘Today’s idea. Tomorrow’s standard.’”

# Here’s What You Missed at the 2018 Vectorworks Design Summit

Earlier this month, 600+ Vectorworks users from 18 countries met in sunny Arizona for three days of indispensable workshops, inspired design, and improved connections. Attendees had access to 90 hours of training, including AIA and ASLA CEU credits.

The fourth annual [Vectorworks Design Summit](https://www.vectorworks.net/design-summit?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=designsummit11202018) took place at the [Sheraton Grand at Wild Horse Pass](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/hotel-rooms/phxwp-sheraton-grand-at-wild-horse-pass/), just outside Phoenix in the breathtaking Sonoran Desert. Educational sessions were held indoors, but attendees had the opportunity to spend time outside for breakfasts, lunches, and the customer appreciation party, complete with a surprise fireworks display.

Designers had the opportunity to attend two keynote presentations. Monday’s presentation, “The Future of Design,” was led by Vectorworks CEO Dr. Biplab Sarkar and featured comments from eight members of the Vectorworks team. The talk included updates about the state of the company, future trends in design, and some of the great new features in [Vectorworks 2019](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/2019?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=designsummit11202018). 

A highlight of the Summit was Tuesday’s keynote, “Site Specificity and the Aura of Globalization,” presented by award-winning architect [Antoine Predock](http://www.predock.com/). Predock shared insights to his design process and how he gets his inspiration for projects. He was joined on stage by Paul Fehlau, executive senior associate at the office of Antoine Predock Architect, who has been working with Antoine for 25 years. Fehlau shared how the firm began using Vectorworks more than two decades ago. 

In addition to the keynotes, educational sessions, and networking opportunities, attendees were invited to unleash their creativity on a mural at our social station.

# Toolsets for Success: 3 Prize-winning Designs

Vectorworks loves supporting student designers. Our Design Scholarship does just that — it’s a chance for students to win a substantial cash prize along with recognition in the realm of design.

Take a look at these 2017 winners from Germany and Austria and the Vectorworks tools that brought them their glory.

###### **Alexander Drachenberg**

Drachenberg, then a [University of Wuppertal](https://www.uni-wuppertal.de/en/) student, submitted a project he calls[ “The Other Place.”](https://alexanderdrachenberg.com/the-other-place)

The building extends the width of the inner harbor in Hamburg, Germany, serving as both a bridge and a museum. Drachenberg’s vision was to create a space that “intends to be a kind of amplifier of this virtual-physical reality,” he writes on his website. “The Other Place” is an interactive museum which “reflects on the multiple diverse identities of the digital world.”

With [Vectorworks Designer](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/designer?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=2017Scholarship052819), Drachenberg cited his appreciation of the[ ever-growing content library](http://app-help.vectorworks.net/2019/eng/VW2019%5FGuide/ResourceManager/Resources.htm?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=2017Scholarship052819), adding that it let efficiency thrive. “I can start with everything from detail to the site plan with little effort,” he said.

###### **Florian Rothermel**

Rothermel, a graduate of [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://www.kit.edu/english/index.php), wanted his project to showcase his interest in the relationship between natural power and human structures. So he designed a railway station in the Alps called “[Bergwärts](http://ebooks.computerworks.eu/vectorworks/stipendium/2017/rothermel-d-a/mobile/index.html#p=14).”

_Florian Rothermel, whose project “_[_Bergwärts_](http://ebooks.computerworks.eu/vectorworks/stipendium/2017/rothermel-d-a/mobile/index.html#p=14)_” was recognized in the 2017 Vectorworks Design Scholarship. Image courtesy of Florian Rothermel._

Rothermel used Vectorworks’ powerful 3D capabilities to visualize his design from the onset. The software offered him an intuitive space to generate a remarkable rendering from 2D schematics.

###### **Sophia Rodermund**

We recognized Sophia Rodermund, a [Hochschule Ostwestfalen-Lippe University of Applied Sciences](https://www.th-owl.de/en/international.html) graduate, for her interior design work on “[Dormouse – Staying in the Old Barn](http://ebooks.computerworks.eu/vectorworks/stipendium/2017/rodermund-d-a-ch/mobile/index.html#p=5).”

“During the design process, it is possible to quickly and easily switch between different modes of presentation, and to easily make changes and adjustments to the drawings,” she said of her use of Vectorworks. “That's exactly the advantage for me.”

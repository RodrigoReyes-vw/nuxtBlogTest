# Design Day Recap: Catch What You Missed

Vectorworks Design Day is in the books — but if you missed any of the three live sessions, we have a full recap for you. Find everything about the event in this blog post, including where you can watch the sessions on-demand.

[Production design](http://vectorworks.net/spotlight?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=101520designday) is in our blood. We make Vectorworks Spotlight, after all! We ran the event from our headquarters in Columbia, MD with help from team members worldwide. We brought our A-game and we’re pumped about how it turned out — being our first time doing a live virtual show to this caliber, feedback from registrants has been incredibly gratifying. Here are some behind-the-scenes shots:

It takes a talented team of dedicated people to pull off a live Q&A for a global audience. We received so many thought-provoking questions, but with a jam-packed itinerary, we couldn’t get to all of them within the sessions’ time frames. We’ve compiled answers on our Community Forum.

If you weren’t able to make it to the live show, all of the content is still available for you to watch at your convenience. Check out [our blog](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/we-want-to-hear-from-you-at-vectorworks-design-day.html) to meet the guest presenters, each of whom has a session ready to go on the event page. Be sure to also catch the #Vectorworks2021 sessions with our CEO and leadership as they explore this release’s theme — [simplicity to design the complex](http://vectorworks.net/2021?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=101520designday) — and how the development philosophy is pervasive across each of our industries. Closed captioning for each session is available in multiple languages.

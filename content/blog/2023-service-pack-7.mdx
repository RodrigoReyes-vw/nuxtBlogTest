#### macOS Sonoma Compatibility

We've been working with Apple and their Sonoma betas from the day they released news of their next macOS version. We’re happy to say our experience with the latest Vectorworks 2023 Service Pack 7 and our upcoming release of Vectorworks 2024 has been quite positive.

While we’ve encountered some items within Sonoma’s new functionality, we’ve addressed most of the issues found at this time in Vectorworks 2023 and the upcoming release of Vectorworks 2024.

We’ll continue to test with the beta, but further issues may be discovered in the final release of macOS Sonoma, and we’ll work to resolve them. Before you upgrade to macOS Sonoma, [follow this tech bulletin](https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/articles.html/articles/tech-bulletins/macos-sonoma/) to stay informed on Vectorworks compatibility.

# February Webinars | Take One Step Closer to Design Mastery

Some say that it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill.

You’ve likely heard of this hypothesis, made popular by [Malcolm Gladwell’s _Outliers_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Outliers/ialrgIT41OAC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=malcolm+gladwell+10000+hours&printsec=frontcover).

10,000 hours can feel a bit overwhelming, though. That’s why we recommend just starting with one. Learn a new skill or try a new feature by watching one of our free February webinars.

10,000 hours starts with one.

## Case Study: Digitally Modeled Lake House

_Aired February 21_

Alchemy Architects' [Squam Lake house](https://www.archdaily.com/971581/the-design-process-and-off-site-construction-of-alchemys-squam-lake-residence) is a practical case study in selecting and using digital modeling tools to design complex geometries, communicate intent, and deliver successful projects.

The house is metaphorically a box of trees. With an interior entirely of oak, it embraces the spirit of the densely wooded site. The metaphoric trees bring in light and ventilation, while defining spaces, circulation, storage, and a separate boathouse. The house was digitally modeled using BIM software, allowing the house’s envelope and tree forms to be CNC-fabricated. During this course, the BIM and scripted-algorithm process will be discussed, as well as the transfer and communication of this information to fabricators.

This webinar is approved for one AIA LU/HSW.

## Biourbanism for Resilient Cities

_Aired February 23_

An interdisciplinary concept founded on landscape architecture, urban design, and ecological sciences, Biourbanism is a method that assists mayors, city leaders, and city planners to create healthier, more resilient cities. Biourbanism is centered around five urban and five bio systems that analyze city health: economy, energy, mobility, structure, technology, water, food, waste, landscape, and humanity. 

[Simply put, the philosophy believes cities must be considered a form of nature to fight the climate crisis. ](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/pioneering-biourbanism-using-design-tools.html)

In this webinar, Adrian McGregor, chief design officer of McGregor Coxall, professor, and author, will discuss Biourbanism and realistic roadmaps for cities and communities to achieving resilience.

This webinar is approved for one LA CES PDH and one APLD CEU.

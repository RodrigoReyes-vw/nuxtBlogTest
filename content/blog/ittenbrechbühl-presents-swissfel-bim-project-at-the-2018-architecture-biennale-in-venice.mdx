Architecture and general planning practice [IttenBrechbühl](https://www.ittenbrechbuehl.ch/en) exhibited a spatial installation with images of the [SwissFEL](https://www.psi.ch/swissfel/), Switzerland’s X-ray free-electron laser, at the renowned Architecture Biennale in Venice.

**Created with the Latest BIM Planning Methods**

A Vectorworks user for many years, the Swiss architecture firm used a BIM workflow to plan the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), the large-scale research facility of the SwissFEL building.

Unveiled on May 24, [the installation by IttenBrechbühl](https://www.ittenbrechbuehl.ch/node/5900) demonstrates the firm’s use of BIM planning for the design of the building, which houses one of the world's four free-electron X-ray lasers. The installation shows backlit images of the institute in a black cube — the building’s architecture is the ultimate in precision. The photographs show the 750-meter-long SwissFEL building in its scientific sobriety and its manifold complexity.

# An Effective Game Plan: New Partnership Makes Unique Win-Win

Giving back is always in season, and this holiday season, we partnered with [Bridges to Housing Stability](http://www.bridges2hs.org/) to help the organization in its mission to provide a path to self-sufficiency to prevent and end homelessness in Howard County, Maryland.

For over 27 years, Bridges to Housing Stability has served the local community by providing affordable housing solutions and advocacy. This year alone, Bridges has helped provide housing to more than 300 Howard County residents.

The goal for our first community service event with Bridges to Housing Stability is to provide local families with gifted board games that they can enjoy as a family and come together this holiday season. We began collecting the games as well as other gifts for children in November, and our staff has already brought in 75 gifts. Last week, more than 40 Vectorworks volunteers stopped by during a gift-wrapping event to wrap the gifts donated by staff, as well as some additional gifts brought in by Bridges to Housing Stability.

"Thanks to all the Vectorworks employees who donated and wrapped gifts — you lightened the burden of many low-wage earning Howard County families this holiday season,” says Kelly McLaughlin, executive director for Bridges to Housing Stability. “We look forward to our continued partnership to help families in our community achieve self-sufficiency through stable and affordable housing." 

In the future, we plan to partner with Bridges to Housing Stability on other meaningful projects. For now, we’re continuing to gather gifts until December 20\. Anyone interested in joining in the giving spirit can drop off a board game at Bridges’ headquarters, located on 9520 Berger Road, Suite 311 in Columbia, Maryland, or make a donation on the [Bridges to Housing Stability](http://bridges2hs.org/join-the-solution/giving/) website.

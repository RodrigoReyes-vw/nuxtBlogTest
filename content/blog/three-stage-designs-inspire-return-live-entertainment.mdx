# Three Inspiring Stages to Celebrate the Return of Live Entertainment

Despite the continued relevance of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the delta variant, many live acts have set back out on tour. 

The return to the stage has been a powerful one. And one thing is for certain: absence makes the heart grow fonder. So, to honor the return of live entertainment, here are three stage designs that may inspire your next project with [Vectorworks Spotlight](https://www.vectorworks.net/spotlight).  

###### Shoreline City Church

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, managing the health and safety of the public has been top of mind for many event planners and designers. This consideration is what led [Shoreline City Church](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/visual-edge-lighting-a-large-event-under-covid-19.html) to holding their first arena services in Dallas’ American Airlines Center.

“A big challenge for this event was that Shoreline had never done arena events before,” said Jacob VanVlymen, designer and draftsman at [Visual Edge](https://visualedge.co/), who’ve also designed for the likes of Justin Bieber, Lorde, and The Weeknd. “It required a lot of conversation up-front about how to do this in a COVID-friendly way.”

Not only were Visual Edge able to scale the event while still adhering to safety guidelines, but they were able to put together a breathtaking production for all to enjoy. The modular, diamond-shaped design continued the aesthetic traditions of the church’s previous productions and allowed for all attendees to see the entire show.

###### The Weeknd's "Starboy: Legend of the Fall" Tour

Let’s take a look back at some exceptional designs from before the pandemic, as well.

As one of the most famous acts in pop music today, The Weeknd is known for exceptional live events and performances, like the Toronto singer’s [internet-breaking Super Bowl half-time performance in 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rhadTURsrw).

But it’s The Weeknd’s 2017 world tour, “Starboy: Legend of the Fall,” that we find truly out of this world.

Taking cues from _Starboy’s_ interstellar themes, the tour’s focal point was its origami spaceship which hovered over The Weeknd as he performed. To light the impressive structure, [SRae Productions](http://sraeproductions.com/) trusted a combination of MA Lighting consoles, Robe BMFL, Robe Spikie, Clay Paky Mythos, VDO Sceptrons, and Vectorworks Spotlight.

###### Justin Timberlake's "20/20 Experience" Tour 

World-renowned lighting designer [Nick Whitehouse](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-fireplay/) creates awe-inspiring light shows for some of the biggest names in music, such as Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Britney Spears, and Coldplay. 

Whitehouse and Justin Timberlake developed a collaborative relationship when the latter was floored with the design of a Coldplay show he attended.

After designing Timberlake’s “FutureSex/LoveShow” arena tour, Whitehouse designed 2014’s “20/20 Experience_”_ tour.

Whitehouse’s Vectorworks design incorporated a moving bridge, new laser systems, as well as integrated video projection. During one part of the show, Whitehouse made it appear as if holes opened along the back wall of the stage. This visual treat functioned like a large art installation that revolved around a 150-foot-wide by 60-foot-high hexagon wall and overhead hexagon ceiling, which combined to provide a giant projection surface for video content. 

The tour was an _experience_, indeed.

#### Keys to Production & Set Design Collaboration

_Aired April 24_

With the number of departments working on film and television sets, efficient collaboration is crucial.

Watch experienced designers Dawn Snyder and AE Chadwick for a detailed look at the collaborative workflow between production and set design.

In the first part of the webinar, Snyder will discuss how production designers gather research and create a "look" for a project before sharing their vision with set designers. Then, Chadwick will show how he uses that information to make working drawings, leveraging the power of Vectorworks’ layers and classes and his own library of custom PIOs to communicate the production designer's vision to the rest of the team.

###### Architecture: Improving Building Delivery with BIM

_Tuesday, April 20 @ 2 PM ET_

 Deliver better buildings faster and for less money with BIM. The biggest advantage of BIM capabilities lies with the owner. Our industry needs to continue to develop our delivery methods through the use of BIM, which provides the ability to serve our clients better by establishing budgets much earlier in the process, reducing risk to the owner and virtually eliminating the “VE Stage” of a project. In this webinar, learn how to use BIM to accelerate schedules by involving sub-consultants earlier into our process and to reduce the cost through the elimination of the constant “round up” that takes place through the current system.

Attendees are eligible for 1 AIA LU and 1 Core Learning Credit via AANB, ALBNL, NSAA, and AIBC.

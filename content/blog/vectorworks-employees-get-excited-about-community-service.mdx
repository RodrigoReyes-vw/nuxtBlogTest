# Vectorworks Employees Get Excited About Community Service

At Vectorworks, we believe in taking time to give back to the communities we call home. Our community service program is structured to do this, both here and in the UK.

“This year, we began providing our employees with dedicated volunteer time each year,” said Colleen McLoughlin, human resource specialist at Vectorworks. “It’s been wonderful to see how different teams throughout the company have made a difference by supporting various community organizations.”

The organizations we’ve supported with volunteer time so far include [Meals on Wheels](https://www.mealsonwheelsmd.org/), [Bridges to Housing Stability](http://bridges2hs.org/), and more. Here is a recap of some of our recent community service projects. 

Employees in our UK office chose to help the Grenfell community rebuild after a devastating tragedy. In May, they rolled up their sleeves to help rebuild a city center destroyed by the June 2017 fire at Grenfell Tower. Their efforts were part of a larger project documented for the television series [DIY SOS](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006pnjk).

The employees moved objects around at the construction site, maintained the site for construction workers lifting unwanted material, plastered the walls, and helped motivate the team.

Because of their hard work and perseverance, a brand new multi-space community center was built for all residents to enjoy.

“This was an amazing opportunity and thoroughly rewarding for my colleagues and me to get involved and give back,” said Amisha Carribon, volunteer coordinator and sales program manager in the UK.

Meanwhile, Kristin Bailey and Chiffonia Lloyd, coordinators of the community service program in our Columbia, Maryland office, continue to bring new volunteer opportunities for employees to get involved. 

One of our most successful efforts to date was the holiday gift wrapping event we hosted last December. During the holiday season, employees were asked to donate a game to give to families being helped by Bridges to Housing Stability. Overall, employees donated almost 80 games for players of all different ages.

But we didn’t stop there. We also donated time to wrap other gifts Bridges had received from donors.

More recently, employees participated in an [Earth Day cleanup](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/vectorworks-employees-get-down-and-dirty-honoring-earth-day.html) in April, an Adopt-a-Road cleanup in May, and a Meals on Wheels event in June. This July, we are looking forward to volunteering for the 9th year at The National Association of Landscape Professionals’ Renewal and Remembrance event at Arlington National Cemetery.

“The goal over the course of the year is to offer a variety of activities,” said Bailey. “We want as many people as possible to have a chance to give back to the community. And we are off to a great start!”

We are always glad to take time to give back!

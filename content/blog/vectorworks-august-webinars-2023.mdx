# August Webinars | Now Available On Demand!

August brought a fresh month of webinars and fresh opportunities to hone your design skills.

Scroll down to see what your industry's webinar was and watch it on demand. 

#### **PHOTOGRAMMETRY & POINT CLOUDS WITH THE NOMAD APP**

_Aired August 15_

You can explore the potential of photogrammetry and point cloud capture for landscape projects using [Nomad, a Vectorworks app for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/using-apple-tech-to-streamline-mobile-pdf-workflows.html).

In this webinar, watch the fundamentals of these technologies, including how they work and what they can achieve. You’ll see how Nomad can act as a companion for capturing site inventory, participate in the design phase, and be used for as-built documentation. 

This session also covers practical tips and best practices for using Nomad to generate 3D models from photos and capture point clouds with the iPhone's internal LiDAR scanner.

#### STREAMLINING WORKFLOWS FOR DATA-DRIVEN DOCUMENTATION 

_Aired August 22 | Approved for one AIA LU, AAA LU, AIBC CORE_

Spend more time designing and less time documenting by transitioning from a 2D to a 3D workflow. The benefits go beyond visualization aspects of 3D modeling. Creating a Building Information Model (BIM) will allow you to largely automate your workflow because BIM objects have built-in data that can be extracted using documentation tools. 

Sarah Barrett, associate AIA and senior architect product specialist of Vectorworks, explains the purposes of the tools as well as how to efficiently document your model.

Rewatch this webinar to maximize your data automation and leverage smart tools for documentation and drawing.

#### DATA-DRIVEN DESIGN FOR LIVE EVENTS

_Aired August 23_ 

Successful live event design isn’t only about the aesthetics of an event. It also requires effective and efficient data management on your end. From time and budget planning to knowing seating assignments, being able to document your live event’s data is invaluable.

This webinar — using a gala-style dinner as an example — shows how you can benefit from integrating Vectorworks Spotlight’s data management and analysis tools into your design and planning processes.

#### ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE FUTURE OF LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE

_Aired August 29_

Vectorworks was proud to sponsor a webinar with the [Landscape Architecture Foundation](https://www.lafoundation.org) on the future of landscape architecture.

A panel discussion featuring AI experts, Karla Saldaña Ochoa, Jeff Cutler, Zihao Zhang, and moderator Phillip Fernberg, covers the marriage of AI and landscape architecture.

#### Algorithms-Aided Design in BIM Software

_Aired August 30_

Algorithms-aided design tools are quickly becoming a standard of the AEC industry. They can bring endless opportunities for customization and automation within your design software and allow you more experimentation and optimization within your designs. Algorithms-aided design can be intimidating, but the most important thing you need to get started is a problem you want to solve. Once you get started, the true possibilities begin to open up. 

In this presentation, Sarah Barrett, associate AIA and senior architect product specialist of Vectorworks, discusses some basics of algorithmic modeling, gives some examples of scripts that you can build in BIM software, and looks at several real-world algorithmic modeling success stories.

# Vectorworks Users Excel in Swiss Architecture Awards

Toward the end of 2018, the Swiss architecture and design magazine [Hochparterre](https://www.hochparterre.ch/) gave out awards for the year’s best designs in landscaping and architecture, and many of the winners are [Vectorworks](https://www.vectorworks.net/en?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fcontent=swissawards012519&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fcontent=swissawards012519&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext) users.

This year marks the 25th anniversary of the awards show at the Museum für Gestaltung in Zurich, hosted by Hochparterre. The magazine honored "[Die Besten 2018](https://www.hochparterre.ch/diebesten/blog/post/detail/das-sind-die-besten-2018/1543504144/)," the best of 2018, with its trademark trophy, the hare, awarded in gold, silver, and bronze.

“Die Besten is one of the most important and oldest architecture prizes in Switzerland that honors the most outstanding buildings of the year in Switzerland,” said Andreas Kling, CEO of [ComputerWorks AG](https://www.computerworks.ch/software/vectorworks.html). “The fact that five of the six awards given in architecture and landscape architecture were awarded to offices that plan their extraordinary projects with Vectorworks shows the importance of our software for creative people in Switzerland.”

Here’s a look at the five Vectorworks users that took home a precious metal bunny this year.

**Gold in Architecture: Pool Architekten**

The new FHNW Campus in Muttenz, designed by [Pool Architekten](https://www.poolarch.ch/), will receive this year's golden hare in the architecture sector.

The new building on Muttenzer Gleisfeld has 12 upper and two lower levels. The space includes an auditorium, cafeteria, library, seminar rooms, workshops, studios, offices, laboratories, two sports halls, and 16 lecture halls. More than 60 meters tall, the building houses the individual institutes of the five newly merged universities of architecture, construction and geomatics, life sciences, social work, education, and mechatronics. The FHNW Campus Muttenz now has 3,700 students and 800 lecturers and staff.

"A monumental atrium opens the room through two courtyards to the roof, so visitors lift their heads like as if in a cathedral. Stairs criss-cross \[through\] the air. Behind the rational façade hides an architectural eye-opening experience,” writes Hochparterre.

**Silver in Architecture: Dreier Frenzel**

In Renens, [Dreier Frenzel Architecture and Communication](https://www.dreierfrenzel.com/architecture/) designed a sophisticated new residential building: a multi-family house, which sets a contemporary accent between residential buildings from the 19th and 20th centuries. The house features a staircase outside to gain more living space.

**Gold in Landscape Architecture: Burgfelden Park of Basel – Bryum**

The golden hare for landscape architecture goes to the Burgfelden Park of Bryum in Basel. The "Office for Urban Interventions and Landscape Architecture" combines open spaces with the Burgfelden Park and brings Basel and Saint-Louis together. What began structurally with a path, some signs, and dismantled fences, has developed into a thriving habitat.

**Silver in Landscape Architecture: Studio Vulkan**

The silver hare in the landscape category goes to [Studio Vulkan](https://www.studiovulkan.ch/en/) from Zurich. The garden of the new St. Gall Nature Museum deals with the subject of artificial naturalness and natural artificiality. The task was not easy: what can the design of a natural history park look like over a motorway tunnel between sports facilities, housing estates, and arterial roads today?

**Bronze in Landscape Architecture: Égü Landscape Architects**

The bronze hare goes to the driftwood rake in the Sihl by Égü Landscape Architects. The interplay of engineering and landscape architecture reveals driftwood retention as a visible intervention with a defined beginning, precise transitions, and a clear ending.

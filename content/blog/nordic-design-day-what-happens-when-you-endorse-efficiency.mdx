# Nordic Design Day: What Happens When You Endorse Efficiency

This year’s Nordic Design Day took place in Helsinki, Finland on September 28 at the Finlandia Hall, where attendees from interior design, architecture, landscape, and entertainment design gathered to gain insights on the latest technology during this one-day event full of thought leadership, inspiration, and networking. 

To kick off the event, designers from Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, and Denmark had the opportunity to hear from CEO Dr. Biplab Sarkar about the powerful new features in Vectorworks 2019 and how to use Vectorworks for design and rendering to best maximize work efficiency.

“I see great potential for Vectorworks in Nordic market amongst their designers,” said Sarkar. “I believe Vectorworks is the best product to allow design freedom and convert 2D users to a 3D workflow. I was very impressed with the presenters from Finland and Estonia and the quality of their projects using Vectorworks.” 

To illustrate a workflow using Vectorworks, Finland firm Bright presented a “behind-the-scenes” look at several of their projects and events. Attendees discovered how the firm uses a wide variety of tools in their everyday design process and shared how Vectorworks seamlessly ties all of these tools together to create a stunning finished product.

Another presentation came from Hanna-Lisa Mötus, an architect at 3+1 Architects. In her session, she showed how Vectorworks has helped the firm work through different stages and scales. A small, 12-person firm, Mötus shared how the group trained themselves in the software and used its intuitive capabilities to design a wide range of projects.

###### Architecture | Energy Modeling in the Early Design Phase

_Tuesday, August 17 | 2 pm EST_

Climate change and sustainable designs are at the forefront of today’s conversation. When doing sustainable and energy-efficient design, integrated design tools can help you be more efficient and make quicker decisions during design phases. In this webinar, attendees will learn how to assess the energy performance of a building very early on in an integrated design process — this gives architects the power to make informed design decisions, as well as the ability to back those decisions up.

This course is approved for 1 AIA HSW LU.

###### Landscape | Integrating Design Technology for Water Efficient Landscapes 

_Thursday, August 19 | 2 pm EST_

Designing landscapes with sustainability in mind is no longer a matter of preference but one of meeting jurisdictional requirements. Site designers are increasingly leaning on design software and online resources to make their current design workflows easier, and also to help meet the new obligations in water-efficient site design. By incorporating the water needs of proposed plants, designing hydrozones for irrigation and calculating water budgets, design applications help you to plan for beautiful landscapes that maximize water efficiency.

This course is approved for 1 LA CES HSW PDH and 1 APLD CEU.

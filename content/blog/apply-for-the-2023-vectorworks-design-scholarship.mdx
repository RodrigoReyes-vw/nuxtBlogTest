# The Vectorworks Design Scholarship is Your Chance to Win Big!

It’s that time again. We’re now accepting submissions for the 2023 Vectorworks Design Scholarship!

If you’re an undergraduate or graduate student pursuing a degree related to architecture, interior design, landscape architecture, landscape design, or entertainment design, this scholarship competition is an opportunity for you to receive both recognition and a monetary award.

Note that submission dates and deadlines vary slightly based on the country and/or region where you live. [**Visit our scholarship site**](https://www.vectorworks.net/scholarship) to see when you can apply for your region.

Regional winners are chosen from all qualified submissions. Based on your region, you can win up to $3,000 USD. All regional winners then have a chance to win $7,000 USD grand prize, the Richard Diehl Award. In total, you could win up to $10,000 USD.

“We’re committed to helping students achieve their design goals, and this design scholarship is one way we underscore this commitment,” said Jen Hart, Vectorworks’ academic marketing programs specialist. “Students can win a scholarship by submitting a design that they've worked on during their educational journey.”

Meanwhile, Steven Chavez recognized how even submitting to such competitions can prepare designers for the demands of the industry: "The benefit of competitions is that they provide a particular rigor that ups our game and expands our way of thinking about design projects." 

 Ashley Scheidel, another of our judges, shared more advice for aspiring designers, "As a design student, fully immerse yourself in the worlds of art and design. Dive into your studios, work at an art gallery, intern at design firms, and travel. Design is something to live and breathe. Not just put to paper or computer."

#### 2022’s Grand Prize Winner

2022’s Richard Diehl Award winner was Michelle Wanitzek for her “Nomad Coworking” project.

[View all the winning and runner-up submissions here.](https://www.vectorworks.net/scholarship/winners)

The winning project, which Wanitzek submitted for her master's thesis at Fakultät Gestaltung Wismar, features a coworking space and coffeeshop in a listed monument — a site identified for its architectural or historical significance — and focuses on the increasing importance of alternative and flexible workspaces. The design tackled a challenging task — working with a historical monument's intricacies and structural limits while simultaneously preserving the protected façade and showcasing the transformation for experiential value. 

“With a progressive idea of what monument protection means, Michelle designed an infrastructure in the middle of Wismar’s Old Town, which is suitable to revitalize the city and capable of giving the monument a contemporary purpose,” said the [**University of Wismar**](https://www.hs-wismar.de/) Dean of the Faculty of Design Prof. Dipl.-Ing. Oliver Hantke. “Her concept of multi-layered use picks up on current trends in the construction industry, including sustainability and efficiency strategy, utilizing historical buildings, revitalizing small-town structures, new forms of working environments, and providing communication structures to strengthen social cohesion.”

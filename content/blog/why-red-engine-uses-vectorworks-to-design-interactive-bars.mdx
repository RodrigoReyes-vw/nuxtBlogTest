# High-Flying & Electric Interactive Bars Designed with Vectorworks

Darts are flying, high-energy shuffleboard games are underway, and moments are being created every night — all thanks to [Red Engine's](https://red-engine.com/) exciting designs.

Priding themselves on “disrupting the hospitality industry by creating and delivering the best possible experiences,” Red Engine is the award-winning team behind [Flight Club](https://flightclubdarts.com/) and [Electric Shuffle](https://electricshuffle.com/).

Read on to learn more about Red Engine’s design work for the interactive bars, as well as why the firm picked [Vectorworks Architect](https://www.vectorworks.net/architect) as their design software of choice.

## Exciting Designs, Exciting Times

Flight Club, a darts bar with locations in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, hosts an eclectic design with festive lights and warm touches.

The goal for all the Flight Clubs, like the Cardiff location pictured below, is to “redefine moments with friends. Bringing groups together for the best experience possible,” [says the firm](https://red-engine.com/case-study/islington).

Red Engine’s Electric Shuffle locations feature a warmth similar to Flight Club, but instead of the fun around a dart board, it’s centered around shuffleboards.

With Electric Shuffle, [according to their site](https://red-engine.com/case-study/control-panel), Red Engine aimed to create spaces that were “surprisingly competitive, delightfully immersive, and outrageously thrilling.”

## Why Red Engine Uses Vectorworks Architect

While some of Red Engine’s earlier endeavors were collaborations with outside agencies, the company decided in 2020 to establish an internal design team. It was then that Red Engine adopted Vectorworks Architect.

According to a case study from [Cadventure](https://www.cadventure.co.uk/), the firm chose Vectorworks for, easy-to-use graphics and stylized renderings_._ “One of the great things about Vectorworks for us apart from the drawing functionality is the rendering capability on elevations and the sketchy line appearance, which give it more of a hand-drawn effect,” the firm said.

Vectorworks also helped Red Engine work with different format exports, measurement units, and other obstacles that come with trying to create projects around the world.

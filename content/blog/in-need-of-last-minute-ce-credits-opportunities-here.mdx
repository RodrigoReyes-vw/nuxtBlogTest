[ A Placemaking Approach to Design: 1 AIA LU HSW The days of designing for a discrete project are numbered. Today's most forward-thinking architects are finding it their mission to go beyond their project — in terms of both space and time — to consider, and even encourage, land-use patterns in the surrounding area, and to anticipate, and even influence, future events and unexpected consequences. This _Architectural Record_ webinar will illustrate the practices of land-use planning, placemaking, and intelligent urbanism and how implementing these practices can have a positive effect on individuals and surrounding communities throughout the life cycle of a project. ![Universal Design.png](https://blog.vectorworks.net/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/171205_End%20of%20Year%20CE%20Credits/Universal%20Design.png?width=1024&name=Universal%20Design.png) ](https://continuingeducation.bnpmedia.com/courses/vectorworks-inc/a-placemaking-approach-to-design-web-live/)

Many are discovering that the type of visualization and information that Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology can provide is invaluable. This _Architect Magazine_ article explores how a number of architects are using BIM to successfully create appealing and functional buildings that achieve universal design. ![BIM as an Investment.jpg](https://blog.vectorworks.net/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/171205_End%20of%20Year%20CE%20Credits/BIM%20as%20an%20Investment.jpg?width=1024&name=BIM%20as%20an%20Investment.jpg) ](http://reg.hanleywood.com/rf/4001053/9339373/s/AROL/a/4875)

[Written by Peter J. Arsenault, FAIA, NCARB, LEED AP, this _Architectural Record_ article discusses how BIM and advanced computer software tools produce very favorable results for design professionals, building owners, and firms of all sizes. Through specific examples highlighting firms including ](https://continuingeducation.bnpmedia.com/courses/vectorworks-inc/building-information-modeling-bim-as-an-investment/)[King + King Architects](http://www.kingarch.com/) and [The Design Büro](http://www.thedesignburo.co.uk/), learn how BIM can be successfully implemented into broader design and management strategy.

Building Information Modeling continues to become the industry standard, with many projects now requiring the delivery of BIM files. However, considering the implications of a BIM workflow only after starting said projects can lead to serious issues, which is why this presentation will expand upon the planning processes needed to adopt BIM in your firm. Attendees will also examine what a successful BIM transition looks like in practice through example case studies, exploring both why and how firms are already growing their businesses with BIM.

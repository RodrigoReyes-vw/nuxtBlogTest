# Vectorworks Showcases Emerging Technologies at AIA

Last week, members of the Vectorworks team traveled to New York City for the [AIA Conference on Architecture 2018](http://conferenceonarchitecture.com/). The annual AIA conference offers three days of educational sessions, keynote speakers, training, and an expo hall focused on architecture and design.

Our architectural industry experts offered demos of [Vectorworks 2018](http://www.vectorworks.net/en/2018?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=AIA062918) and examples of our software's BIM capabilities. We also showcased emerging technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality, rendered panoramas, and reality capture.

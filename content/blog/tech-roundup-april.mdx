## Vectorworks and Lumion

Now that [we’ve launched SP3](https://www.vectorworks.net/news/press-releases/vectorworks-inc-announces-lumion-live-sync-rendering-linked-panoramas-and-my-virtual-rig-advancement?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=techroundup0418), we want to help you take advantage of the latest changes. As announced in our recent press release, Lumion has developed the new LiveSync plug-in, which is the first partner plug-in to use a new Vectorworks Graphics Sync (VGS) API. The VGS API provides live access to the Vectorworks 3D scene and enables third parties to connect Vectorworks to any 3D visualization engine imaginable.

You can learn more about how to utilize our partnership with Lumion below.

# Part 2 | Vectorworks Celebrates Women’s Equality Day

At Vectorworks, we whole-heartedly believe in investing in our team members and maintaining an environment built on four core values: balance, collaboration, innovation, and inclusion.

With inclusion, we recognize that there’s strength in our differences. Because of this, we proudly build our team with the best our industries have to offer, regardless of race, gender, sexual preference, or background.  

A few weeks ago, to honor Women’s Equality Day, [we highlighted a few of the amazing women that make Vectorworks so special](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/womens-equality-day.html). **And in this blog, we'll continue to celebrate our diversity by recognizing a few more amazing women at Vectorworks.**

###### Anita Garcia

Anita Garcia has served on the HR team at Vectorworks for three years. Garcia hopes to see women continue to make progress in the workplace for years to come.

She said, “I hope to continue to see a rise in leadership positions for all women; but, specifically, women of color. I also hope that work environments continue to progress in creating an equal work culture.” Garcia said that she would like to see such a culture make diverse hiring a priority, ensure equal pay for all genders, and promote a healthy work/life balance.

###### Pam Murphy

Pam Murphy has been at Vectorworks for two and half years, serving as an accounting associate. When discussing women’s equality, Murphy shared a powerful perspective of “womanhood.”

“To me, ‘womanhood’ represents strength, perseverance, intelligence, drive, and different views of the world. Over my life, I have encountered so many women who see the world differently and have so many inspiring stories to tell. It’s always amazing to me to see the strength that all women possess.”

###### Pooja Shah

Pooja Shah, engineer, has been a vital member of the Vectorworks team for almost five years now. When we asked Shah if she had any advice for young women, her message was clear: “Just do your own thing.”

“When I was in high school, I wanted to play the drums in the band. I went to an all-girls school, and the drummers always looked so cool. But I didn’t have the courage to start learning on my own. I tried to get my best friends to join me, but they wouldn’t,” Shah said. “Then, one day, I told myself, ‘I’m just going to do it.’”

Shah said that she never learned enough drums to join the band, but she remains proud that she pursued her passions. “If I had waited for someone to help me or give me a boost, I never would’ve done something I really enjoyed. Break the norms, limitations, and boundaries. Your life is your own. And if you want to play the drums, girl, play the drums.”

###### Gaby Wang

The fourth — and final — Vectorworks teammate we’d like to shout out is Gaby Wang. Wang has been the general ledger accountant at Vectorworks for two and a half years. One woman Wang looks up to is her mother, who she calls her best friend.

“My mother’s been through a lot in her life. She moved to a new country, learned a new language, worked several hours, supported two kids, and got a master’s degree,” said Wang. Now, according to Wang, her mother is spending her retirement taking care of Wang’s grandmother and aunt, visiting Wang’s son, and writing a book.

“I never thought I could love my mother any more than I already did, but my love for her grew when my son was born, and she became a grandmother. I am so lucky and thankful for having her in my life. I love you, Mom!”

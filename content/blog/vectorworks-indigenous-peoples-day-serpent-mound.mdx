# Highlighting Serpent Mound to Honor Indigenous People’s Day

At Vectorworks, design is at the heart of everything we do. As a design software company, we find ourselves endlessly inspired by great design. Often, many tend to look for the most modern expressions when they speak of “great design,” but some of the best design in the world has been around for thousands of years.

We'd encourage the designers in the industries we serve to look backwards in order to push your designs forward. And one source of such inspiration is the landscape design of Native Americans.

We hold a deep reverence for these designs, and to celebrate Indigenous People’s Day, we’d like to highlight [Ohio’s Serpent Mound](https://www.serpentmound.org/).

## Indigenous People’s Day and Serpent Mound

According to [Smithsonian Magazine](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/blogs/national-museum-american-indian/2020/10/12/indigenous-peoples-day-updated2020/), “Indigenous People’s Day recognizes that Native people are the first inhabitants of the Americas, including the lands that later became the United States of America.” 

We believe it’s incredibly important to celebrate Native American culture.

One of the most breathtaking examples of Native culture is Serpent Mound. Located in Peebles, Ohio, Serpent Mound is a Native effigy that’s a true wonder of landscape design. As the name suggests, Serpent Mound is in the shape of sprawling snake with an open mouth.

Admittedly, Serpent Mound appears a bit other-worldly. It simultaneously feels as though it’s from a distant planet and has _always_ been a part of the natural landscape.

The effigy is also the [world’s largest effigy mound](https://www.history.com/topics/landmarks/serpent-mound), stretching and slithering to an incredible 1,348 feet.

## History of Serpent Mound

Serpent Mound is a captivating piece of earthen design with its own interesting history.

According to [Ohio History Connection](https://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/museum-and-site-locator/serpent-mound), it’s not certain which American Indian culture of Ohio is responsible for the reptile-shaped effigy. For many years, the mound was credited to the [Adena culture](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Adena-culture/), because of several Adena burial mounds in the near vicinity.

However, in 1991 a site excavation took place that challenged this theory. During said excavation, radiocarbon dating suggested the mound was about 900 years old. “This would suggest that the builders of the Serpent belonged to the [Fort Ancient culture](http://touringohio.com/history/fort-ancient-culture.html),” says Ohio History Connection. The organization believes “more work is needed to clarify the age of Serpent Mound.”

## Impact of Serpent Mound

We’re not alone in our appreciation of the great Serpent Mound. Per Ohio History Connection, the mound has been submitted to the [United States Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization](https://en.unesco.org/) (UNESCO) for inscription on the [World Heritage List](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/). If it’s later inscribed into the list, “Serpent Mound will join the ranks of the Pyramids of Egypt, the Great Wall of China, Pompeii, Stonehenge, and the Taj Mahal,” the website says. “World Heritage Status has the potential to elevate local and international awareness about the site’s value, further encourage communities to protect and invest in its preservation and increase potentially beneficial tourism to the site.”

## Landscape Design in 2022

The design of Serpent Mound, as well as its recognition, is a testament to how impactful great design can be. Not only is Serpent Mound a respectful burial site, but it's a site that is considered on par with some of the most iconic designs in the world.

As design software manufacturers, we encourage all to take inspiration for historic sites like Serpent Mound!

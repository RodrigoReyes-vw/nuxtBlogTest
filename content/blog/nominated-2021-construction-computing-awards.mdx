# Vote for Vectorworks in the 2021 Construction Computing Awards

Each year, the [Construction Computing Awards](https://constructioncomputingawards.co.uk/index.php) — or “The Hammers” as they’re also known — reveal their list of nominees “to showcase and reward the technology, tools, and solutions for the effective design, construction, maintenance, and modification of commercial buildings, residential and social housing, and civil engineering projects of all sizes.”

The awards’ website continues, “As ever, our aim is for The Construction Computing Awards to allow companies from every sector of the industry to seek recognition for their efforts over the past 12 months.”

This year, we’re proud to announce that Vectorworks — and one project designed with Vectorworks — has been nominated for _multiple_ Construction Computing Awards.

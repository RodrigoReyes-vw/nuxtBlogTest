# Next Generation of Designers to Benefit from AIAS Partnership

Supporting the next generation of designers is extremely important to us, so we have signed on for a Gold Partnership with [The American Institute of Architecture Students (AIAS)](http://www.aias.org/) and will be sponsoring the AIAS InStudio Render/Sketch competition, which will launch in the fall of 2018.

AIAS members will be asked to share their sketches and renderings to highlight their studio work and provide inspiration for those looking to enhance their own skills. The competition is open to students of all years and skill sets. The first-place winner will receive $300, with second-place and third-place winners taking home $200 and $100, respectively. Last year’s winning entries can be viewed [here](http://www.aias.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/InStudio-Render-Sketch-Comp%5FWinners.pdf). 

“AIAS members like to live on the edge of design, technology, and innovation,” said Nick Serfass, executive director of the AIAS. “As the next generation of architects, the AIAS is excited to partner with Vectorworks, a next-generation technology company. Vectorworks' products and technology can help propel AIAS members to the forefront of the design and architecture professions."

As part of this partnership, we will be at the [AIAS Grassroots Leadership Conference](http://www.aias.org/events/grassroots-2018/) from July 19-22, 2018 in Washington, D.C. and [AIAS FORUM](http://www.aias.org/events/forum-2018/) Dec. 29, 2018 to Jan. 1, 2019 in Seattle, Washington. At both events, designers can learn more about our products and program.

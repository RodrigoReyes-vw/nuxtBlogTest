## Vectorworks ‚Äî For Students and Professionals Alike

In addition to submitting your design this summer, you could also spend some time getting to know [Vectorworks software](https://www.vectorworks.net/products).

![vw_scholarship_p1architect_1200x630-3-e1429535760462](https://blog.vectorworks.net/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/150420_VWX%20Design%20Scholarship/vw_scholarship_p1architect_1200x630-3-e1429535760462.jpg?width=1440&name=vw_scholarship_p1architect_1200x630-3-e1429535760462.jpg)

For example, [Jacob VanVlymen](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/vectorworks-shines-a-spotlight-on-churchgoers.html), a production designer, discovered Vectorworks his junior year of high school. In his spare time, he downloaded the free academic version of the software and devoted time to learning the ropes. Through viewing[**YouTube tutorials**](https://www.youtube.com/user/vectorworks), scouring the[**Vectorworks Forum**](https://forum.vectorworks.net/), and talking over the phone with the Vectorworks support team, VanVlymen made the most of the software and resources available to him.

Although a noted self-starter, VanVlymen wasn‚Äôt the first in his family to pursue a career in lighting design. He admits, ‚Äúdesign runs in the family,‚Äù and he was inspired by his grandfather, whose scenic design portfolio includes high-profile names like ABC Studios and the Metropolitan Opera. Harnessing that familial thread of design savvy, VanVlymen immersed himself into the world of production design.

Now a full-time professional, VanVlymen‚Äôs knowledge of Vectorworks has given him and his team the ability to plan out large-scale events with precision and accuracy. ‚ÄúI can design, I can piece things together, I can understand the room and where we‚Äôre going to rig,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAll of that goes through my head because I‚Äôve drafted on Vectorworks.‚Äù

Vectorworks software is for anyone who wants to create imaginative designs.

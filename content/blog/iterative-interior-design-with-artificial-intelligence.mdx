# How AI Can Help Interior Designers with Iterative Design

Artificial intelligence (AI) has dominated the headlines recently, but are you aware of the role it can play in your interior design workflows?

You can quickly create multiple iterations of your initial design concepts by using programs like [Veras](https://veras.evolvelab.io/), [SketchPro](https://sketchpro.ai/waitlist), or [Davinte](https://davinte.ai/) in tandem with [Vectorworks Architect](https://www.vectorworks.net/). And given how easily you can use AI, you’ll be able to explore design ideas and share different options with your clients.

Continue reading to learn more about the importance of iterative design and how you can use AI with Vectorworks Architect.

#### Iterative Design for Interiors

Design is naturally iterative, with projects being tweaked and evolved constantly. Even if you and your clients have a clear design vision, it’s helpful to provide them with multiple options, whether it be different materials, colors, or geometry.

As Kesoon Chance, senior industry specialist – interior architecture, explains, “Iterative Design is what happens when the ideas are flowing and communication with your client is efficient, there isn't a project existing or in planning that hasn't gone through changes — It’s what’s needed to get the best possible collaboration with the designer and client.”

Once you have your initial idea drawn out in Vectorworks (for example, the office pod above), you can plug it into an AI program of your choosing and begin creating different permutations of your project.

With these options, you can explore ideas of your own. Perhaps you stumbled across a different color combination or shape that you’ll want to experiment with back in Vectorworks. Or, maybe you generate an image that helps your clients realize something they didn’t even know they wanted.

AI programs don’t replace you as a designer, as you need to have an original concept and be able to prompt the program. Nor does it replace a powerful design tool like Vectorworks Architect, as you’ll still need to create worksheets and documentation communicating your design’s exact specifications to builders.

#### Tips for Prompting AI for Iterative Interior Designs 

When using AI applications like Veras, [which is currently in “Active Research” on the Vectorworks Public Roadmap](https://www.vectorworks.net/public-roadmap), it’s important to pay close attention to the prompts you’re entering in the program. We recommend you consider the following:

1. Focus on changing one element of your design at a time.
2. Be specific with your prompts.
3. Don’t get discouraged if you don’t like what the AI program generated. Adjust your prompt, and you’ll have a new visualization in seconds.

With Veras, you can also turn up the geometry override, meaning the AI takes more liberty with the shape of your design elements, as you can see below:

Similarly, sliding up on your material override gives you more variety in the materials used in your projects:

You can also select options like “Is Interior” and “Turbo Nature” within Veras to showcase designs to your clients in multiple different locations.

Ultimately, as you learn to master your AI program and generate the exact images you want, you can efficiently share design options with your clients and quickly get back into Vectorworks to develop detailed plans and documentation.

With more design options comes more design freedom, after all.

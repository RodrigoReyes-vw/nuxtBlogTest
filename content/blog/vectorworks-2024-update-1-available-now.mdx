# Vectorworks 2024 Update 1 Available Now

In our first update to Vectorworks 2024, we’re delivering several quality updates and a new partner product integration for color schemes that can work wonders in the early design phases. We’ll discuss the updates in this blog post, so make sure you’re caught up with features in the new version to get the most out of this post.

[![WHAT'S NEW IN 2024?](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/3018241/83ace893-bffc-41fa-bbc7-f023baf29681.png)](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/3018241/83ace893-bffc-41fa-bbc7-f023baf29681) 

Let’s get into it! The sections below are divided by the industries that primarily benefit from the noted update.

#### Architecture & Interiors | New NCS+ Pro Integration 

NCS+ Pro, a powerful product by NCS Colour, is now integrated into Vectorworks. With an NCS subscription, the integration allows you to work digitally with color to identify, define, and visualize color choices.

Here are a few things you need to know:

* NCS Colour concepts can help build mood and inspiration boards in the early design phases, helping you set the tone for a project.
* NCS+ Pro allows you to integrate color concepts into Vectorworks quickly and in an automated way, right into your Vectorworks Color Palette Manager. This saves time on developing color schemes and design iteration.
* You can install the plugin via the Install Partner Product command (**Help > Install Partner Products**) within the software.

#### Architecture, Landscape Design, & Landscape Architecture

The Railing and Fence tools were introduced in Vectorworks 2024\. New worksheet reporting functions provide increased accuracy in your quantity takeoffs and a better experience working with data.

You'll also find improved texturing for Railing, Hardscape, and Fence objects, which provides better visual quality in Shaded and other Renderworks modes.

For the landscape industries, there’s now better IFC support for Plant, Fence, and Hardscape objects, enabling more effective collaborative workflows.

#### Entertainment

Vectorworks 2024 introduced the Equipment Lists feature, and we’ve made some quality updates to improve your experience.

One such update is added support for Blended Screens and Stage Plugs in Inventory and Equipment Lists.

In addition, in the Equipment Summary Key dialog, you'll discover optimized sorting and expanding of items, making it easier for you to manage your lists. You’ll also find improved alignment of text and symbols in the Equipment Summary Key.

# A Summary of Awards Won in 2022

Winning an award is a gratifying experience for any designer. Awards are validation, recognition, encouragement, and more.

We wanted to take a moment to note some of the award-winning Vectorworks customers from 2022\. Across all industries, the Vectorworks community continues to deliver outstanding projects.

In no way is this an exhaustive list — if you or someone you know has won an award using Vectorworks software, send us your information below for consideration to be added to this article.

Our CEO, Dr. Biplab Sarkar, appeared in several publications last year to discuss the development strategies that are making Vectorworks the go-to choice for many designers.

# November Webinars: Remote Collaboration, AutoTURN, Rapid Digital Prototyping, and Project Sharing

Stay in the know with this month’s FREE webinars.

###### **Vectorworks & AutoTURN: Simulating Vehicle Turning Paths**

_Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2 – 3 pm ET_

If you are designing for event vehicular circulation, commercial parking lots, or residential driveways, being able to understand and accurately simulate vehicle turn maneuvering is essential. With the full integration of Transoft Solutions AutoTURN Online in all Vectorworks software, this design capability helps to simplify this complex task. Using a real-world project file, Nelson Huang, Civil Engineer at Transoft Solutions, Inc. and Eric Gilbey, PLA, Product Marketing Manager at Vectorworks, Inc. will walk you through different simulation scenarios that highlight the intricacies of vehicular use and parking areas, and the details surrounding them.

###### **Design at a Distance: Tools for Remote Collaboration**

**A Sponsored Webinar with Architectural Record**

_Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2 – 3 pm ET_

Modern design software is a tool for remote collaboration, intuitive visualization, and efficient coordination. With projects around the world, Flansburgh has developed a BIM-centric workflow to work remotely with clients, consultants, and contractors. Vectorworks, our primary architectural authoring software, is the centerpiece of this process. This session will explore VR prototyping with The Wild, 3D visualization with Twinmotion, and coordination with Revizto.

###### **Rapid Digital Prototyping and Algorithmic Design**

_Tuesday, Nov. 17, 2 – 3 pm ET_

Creating models or prototypes is not a novel concept in the building design world, but technological advances have taken this idea to new levels and created a surge of potential new opportunities. Influenced by other industries, such as automotive and machinery design, architects now engage in the process of rapid prototyping their designs. By using a digital model as the basis for creating a physical model, either scaled or full size, these physical models can be made using a variety of materials. In this webinar, attendees will look at the link between digital and physical prototyping by exploring specific examples of architects who are using both to achieve their goals.

###### **Globalizing Collaboration with Project Sharing**

_Wednesday, Nov. 18, 2 – 3 pm ET_

Join Mediatec CAD Specialist Peter Pihlblad for a case study on collaboration with project partners from different locations. Pihlblad will explain how he worked with an external audio engineer, video engineer, and production manager to produce a successful event. Explore how the organization of classes and layers sets the stage for an effective project sharing workflow.

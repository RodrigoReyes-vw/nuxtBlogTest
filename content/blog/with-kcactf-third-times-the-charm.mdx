# With KCACTF, Third Time's the Charm!

It’s that time of year again, and the third year that we are sponsoring awards at the [Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival (KCACTF)](http://www.kcactf.org/home/index.html). KCACTF is designed to celebrate college theater in the United States and help students develop their creative and technical skills. Coincidentally, this year marks the 50th anniversary of this national program.

Every year, KCACTF hosts eight regional festivals for college theater students across the United States. The festival activities include workshops, discussions, regional-level scholarships, and award programs. The first regional festival begins on January 8, and the last festival ends on February 28.

“Our involvement with the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival the past two years has been wonderful, and we look forward to supporting the next generation of entertainment professionals once again,” said Frank Brault, product marketing manager at Vectorworks. “This is such a great opportunity for college theater students to showcase their talent, and we can’t wait to see what they come up with.”

As part of our sponsorship, each winner of the eight festivals will receive a free professional license of [Vectorworks Designer](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/designer?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fcontent=kcactf010319&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext), a solution that offers [lighting](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/spotlight?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fcontent=kcactf010319&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext), [rigging](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/braceworks?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fcontent=kcactf010319&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext), and rendering tools in a single interface.

Our ever-growing partner list has added the award-winning LED manufacturer [PixelFLEX](https://pixelflexled.com/). This Nashville-based company has joined the Vectorworks content community to provide ready-to-use LED solutions for all entertainment, architectural, and commercial designs.

Starting in March, the design symbols, images, and specifications for the PixelFLEX FLEXTour, FLEXLite Plus, and FLEXCurtain HD video solutions, including accessories, will be available for download for members of [Vectorworks Service Select](https://serviceselect.vectorworks.net/?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=pixelflex02122018).

PixelFLEX offers creative solutions and dependable service for their LED video display technologies. Users will have access to ready-to-use LED video solutions to create innovative, one-of-a-kind designs for any tour, live event, or permanent installation.

“LED video walls are arguably the fastest growing part of the live event world,” says Chris Baccala, content development manager at Vectorworks. “This partnership with PixelFLEX will give Vectorworks users a massive advantage in accuracy, speed, and flexibility in designing events and installs, as well as retail and hospitality projects.”

The content is exclusively available to Vectorworks Service Select members now, and will become available to all users this fall.

# A Rundown on Shaded Render Mode

You're well aware of the quick turnarounds and time-sensitive demands of the entertainment industry. These demands are also why we’ve dedicated several blog posts on time-saving features and practices with [Vectorworks Spotlight](https://www.vectorworks.net/spotlight). 

Below is a small sampler of posts you might find useful:

In this post, you’ll learn about another Vectorworks improvement: the updates to the Shaded render mode, [introduced in Vectorworks 2023](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/2023-service-pack-5.html).

The updates to the Shaded Render mode offer you the chance to create realistic visualizations of your projects without having to wait for more intensive renderings.

#### What’s Shaded Render Mode in Vectorworks Spotlight?

Shaded render mode is one of the visualization options in your Render Mode dropdown menu. The mode creates quality, detailed renderings with colors, shading, and textures. 

And with the release of Vectorworks 2023, the Shaded render mode in Vectorworks now supports glow textures, lit fog, gobos, texture bump, environmental effects, and reflections.

The updates to the Shaded Render mode also allow unlimited lights in your scene, removing the previous eight-light limit. So, your 3D model will match what your production actually requires in terms of lighting.

Check out this video to learn a little more about the feature and — more importantly — see it in action:

#### Advantages of Shaded Rendering for Live Events, Productions, and More

The biggest advantage of Shaded rendering in Vectorworks, as we already mentioned, is that you can use it to quickly make life-like visuals of your projects. With the speed of the feature and the ease of making edits in real-time, it’s a great way for you and other stakeholders to understand what a production will look like in-person.

You’ll be able to create designs in an environment that better represents the materials you’re using for set pieces, stage elements, etc. If you’re using glass or fiberglass on a stage, for example, Shaded render mode lets you simulate the reflectivity of the material. This way, you can see how the surface may interact with lights or other components of your design.

With environmental effects, lit fog, and gobo shading, too, you can take the 3D models of your productions to the next level.

The advantages speak for themselves, really. Take a look at some of the images below and see what Shaded renderings can do for you:

During COVID times, going out to movies and theaters has been put on hold. Just like home offices are a new trend, architects, designers, and contractors have seen a spike in new commissions based on renovating and transforming dead spaces into family entertainment rooms. In a new webinar series for residential interiors, join Wes Gardner, senior product specialist at Vectorworks, Inc., to learn how you can get these projects started in record time by adopting a new approach to producing drawings and takeoffs. If you are already familiar with digital drafting and have started integrating 3D modeling into your daily workflow, then this is the webinar for you.

 Attendees are eligible for 1 AIA, CORE AIBC, CORE AAA, CORE AANB, ALBNL, and NSAA learning unit per hour.

#### BIM Features in Vectorworks 2023

Data is vital when it comes to BIM, and Vectorworks 2023 makes it more accessible and easier to manage, allowing you to use data to your advantage for more efficient and precise modeling and documentation.

Powerful data reporting additions will simplify the process of creating detailed reports and quantity takeoffs for building objects, allowing for precise reports for walls, slabs, roofs, and railing/fence objects as well as their defining components. 

![Enhanced-Data-Reporting](https://blog.vectorworks.net/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/2022%20PVW%20Images/09_2023%20Launch/Enhanced-Data-Reporting.png?width=500&name=Enhanced-Data-Reporting.png)

The Data Manager’s capabilities have expanded, making it more predictable and easier to use when creating and managing all data types. You can now search, filter, and select multiple data sets, copy and paste information, and apply it to other data sets.

Vectorworks 2023 also offers more control for creating and customizing data tags. You can intuitively find and change data tag object associations, display varying units per instance as needed, and define a scale for use in sheet or design layers.

“Data is a crucial element of BIM or any type of information modeling,” said Rubina Siddiqui, product marketing director at Vectorworks. “Making it more accessible and easier to manage means that designers can take advantage of and use data in a way that doesn’t take their time and focus away from designing.”

Vectorworks 2023 also issues a collection of user-friendly import/export improvements for essential exchanges of DWG and DXF files. You can now customize which items and layers are exported in a file through a new, simplified export dialog. At the same time, when importing, it’s easy to select which layers and objects to include.

#### BIM for Landscape Features in Vectorworks 2023

With improved visual and organizational capabilities and new tools to save time on grading plans and terrain modeling, Vectorworks continues to pave the way to make adopting BIM into landscape workflows simpler.

You can now also take advantage of Vectorworks’ GIS and georeferencing integrations making file collaboration more straightforward by automatically placing referenced files using GIS settings from a master document. Plus, new GIS Settings and Coordinates allow you to note your preferred method of coordinate entry to incorporate georeferencing data more accurately.

#### Entertainment Features in Vectorworks 2023

With a focus on continuous improvement to provide entertainment and lighting designers tools they can trust, version 2023 includes critical upgrades to allow for more efficient and successful workflows.

Rigging design and planning is easier than ever in Vectorworks Spotlight 2023\. Improved integration between hoist and bridle objects allows for more consistent and manageable documentation, and two-leg bridle behaviors have been updated for consistency. Also, increased control over the now symbol-based truss cross object will ease a significant portion of your workflows.

Spotlight users will also find peace of mind with improvements and enhancements in the latest version. Updates to the Shaded Render Mode eliminate the eight-light limit you previously faced, offering more rendering support for textures, gobos, and haze. These features allow you to quickly create and share design concepts and ensure higher quality renderings.

Workflow issues with lighting devices and worksheet functions have also been addressed to deliver simplified drawing capabilities and more precise designs, leaving you more time to focus on the creative process.

# Look Out! Vectorworks Proves It’s “One to Watch”

The votes are in, and Vectorworks was named the winner of the “One to Watch Company” category at the [Construction Computing Awards](http://constructioncomputingawards.co.uk/). Now in its thirteenth year and known as “The Hammers,” the awards program showcases and rewards the technology, tools, and solutions for the effective design, construction, maintenance, and modification of commercial buildings, residential and social housing, and civil engineering projects of all sizes.

## What Design Professionals Are Saying About the Scholarship

We aren’t the only ones who want to see what you’re creating.

Below, a few judges tell why they think you should submit your work to the design scholarship:  
  
> “I’m very excited about the Vectorworks scholarship opportunity for design students preparing to enter the worlds of architecture, lighting, scenic, landscape, and interior design. Being selected by the panel of industry-professional judges will certainly open doors and, in a sense, ‘certify’ the recipient's design skills and provide extensive coverage in trade media — not only for the winning individual or team, but their school as well. A full suite of Vectorworks software for the school is a further bonus.”

> \- **Jeff Ravitz, In** **tensity Advisors** 

> “The Vectorworks Design Scholarship contest is a chance to showcase your work — and highlight the program you’ve been studying in — and get that work in front of an array of experienced, accomplished architecture, interior, landscape, and lighting design professionals from all over the world who want to see your design and communication skills, understand your process, and be amazed by how you use the software to create and present your ideas.”

> 
> “Whether your field is architecture, landscape architecture, entertainment, or interior design, competitions have always played a significant part in the learning process.   
>  
> During my time in architecture school, competitions and scholarships were extremely important in helping propel my career forward. Today I always encourage my students to pursue these opportunities because you never know what doors they’ll open.”

# Meeting BIM Level 2 Requirements in Landscape Architecture

If Ares Landscape Architects Ltd wanted to continue working on public projects, they needed to find a design program that uses a 3D BIM workflow. Vectorworks Landmark provided the solution.

In 2016, [the UK government mandated](https://www.ukbimalliance.org/) the adoption of the [BIM Level 2 framework ](https://bim-level2.org/en/)on all public projects. This requirement enhances collaboration and continuity between all stakeholders on a project — and landscape architects everywhere are adopting BIM [as the industry evolves](/landscape-architecture-is-evolving?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=ares073119).

Since [Ares Landscape Architects ](http://ares.eu.com/)serves clients in the public sector, particularly in education, the Nottingham City Hub presented the perfect opportunity to exercise their new workflow.

Positioned near public transit systems, the revitalized City Hub will serve as a space for both students of [Nottingham College ](https://www.nottinghamcollege.ac.uk/)and the local community. However, the project presented many challenges with structure, site conditions, and collaboration with other regeneration projects in the area.

Ares Landscape Architects embraced these challenges with the help of [Landmark](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/landmark?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=ares073119) — by taking advantage of its 2D to 3D functionality, import/export capabilities, and IFC data.

Sam Bailey, senior landscape architect and BIM coordinator at Ares, said using Landmark helped “speed up the time involved in project drafting and data reporting since the two processes are integrated, while providing useful information for other parties involved.”

You’re in luck! This month’s tech roundup is filled with announcements, improvements, and more!

**Service Pack 3 Release**

The third service pack for the Vectorworks 2018 product line is now available! This release is helping designers harness the power of the cloud with new features, including:

Photos to 3D Model:

You can now easily snap a series of photos on your mobile device and use the [Vectorworks Nomad app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vectorworks-nomad/id506706850?mt=8) to send that data directly to [Vectorworks Cloud Services](http://www.vectorworks.net/cloud-services?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=techroundup0318) to process and create the 3D model from your photos.

“Data at your fingertips,” said Steve Johnson, our vice president of product development. “See it. Capture it. Have fun!”

ICYMI: Here are three new videos to strengthen your Vectorworks expertise. 

## Dual Dimensions

Dual dimensioning displays two sets of values, such as inches and millimeters, within a single dimension. These values have independent unit settings and attributes. In this video, we explore how to display a dimension with both imperial and metric units at the same time.

## Massing Model Tool

The Massing Model Tool creates a building shell for illustrative purposes. This is an easy way to create a representative or context building when a detailed building is not required.

## BIM for Landscape Architects Part 1

In the first of this three-part video series, explore how to start projects with Vectorworks Landmark by taking site inventory from a DWG file and transforming the survey into a contextual urban model â€” providing all the necessary information for the intelligent site analysis that later influences design. With multiple working views, extract information such as water flow arrows, slope analyses, existing trees, and solar animations.

## For all you landscape architects, see how you can take your designs even further with BIM.

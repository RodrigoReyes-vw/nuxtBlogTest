_Layer and Class Filtering:_

Searching through long lists to find the layer and class you’re looking for is a huge pain. In 2019, you can instantly find what you’re looking for by typing in a keyword search or using filters to display classes and layers based upon specific properties. Being able to work with filtered lists, and instantly search to find classes or layers, will significantly improve your productivity.

_Clip Cube Viewport Option:_

You asked for it, and now you can use the clip cube on sheet layer viewports. And, unlike other applications that have limitations on the visualization of clip cubes, Vectorworks enables you to use clip cubes in any rendered view or style, giving you the efficiency and capability you need to create remarkable sections, elevations, and presentation drawings.

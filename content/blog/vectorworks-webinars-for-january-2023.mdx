## Data-Driven Modeling for Interiors

_Aired January 17_

With more technology available to interior and architectural designers, the traditional approach to developing commercial projects is moving to exciting levels.

Your workflow is no longer just about providing 2D drawings and details; great visualizations and smart take-offs can all be a part of your design process. BIM for interiors is a more thoughtful way to design, organize, and face today’s challenges in the industry.

In this presentation — inspired by an elegant retail interiors project located in Tokyo by designers Mana & Takashi Kobayashi, IMA Inc. — Luis M. Ruiz, Int. Assoc. AIA, will discuss how you can increase your efficiency and win more work with an integrated data-driven 3D modeling process.

This course is also approved for one AIA LU.

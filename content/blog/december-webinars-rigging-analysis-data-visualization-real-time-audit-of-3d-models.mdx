# December Webinars: Rigging Analysis, Data Visualization, & Real-time Audit of 3D Models

Stay in the know with this month’s FREE webinars.

###### 

###### **Rigging Analysis and Documentation with Braceworks**

_Wednesday, Dec. 9, 2 – 3 pm ET_

The design, certification, and safe installation of show and event rigging systems is a complex and time-consuming process. Join Jim Woodward, senior entertainment product specialist, as he demonstrates the benefits and ease of use of Braceworks, the rigging analysis add-on module for Vectorworks Spotlight. Woodward will show how to conduct structural analysis with Spotlight rigging tools, analyze the reactions to suspended systems, present a 3D data model complete with a structural analysis report, and much more.

###### **Data Visualization for the Decision-making Process for Landscape Architecture and Design**

_Thursday, Dec. 10, 2 – 3 pm ET_

As your design evolves, enhance your decision-making process by visualizing project data in the live design environment. In this webinar, learn how to leverage the tools in Vectorworks to examine your site and answer questions about it. Explore site analysis and management of existing trees — focusing on features such as species, trunk diameter, and condition. See how to overlay the root zone of existing trees with the construction impact zone to determine which trees will be impacted, leading to a tree management plan.

You can earn 1 LA CES PDH and 1 APLD CEU from this webinar.

###### **Real-time Audit of 3D Models Using Data Visualization in Architecture**

_Tuesday, Dec. 15, 2 – 3 pm ET_

Do more with your BIM model using data visualization. More and more parameters are needed in a BIM process, so maintaining the quality of the data can be difficult. Learn how to integrate tools like the data manager and data visualization for your quality assurance workflow to help minimize data discrepancies with your 3D models. Join Luc Lefebvre and Sarah Barrett to learn how advanced BIM tools can enhance your workflow, reduce errors, and increase quality output for your 3D models.

You can earn 1 AIA LU from this webinar.

# April Webinars: 3D Modeling and Switching to Vectorworks

Maintain accreditation and earn continuing education credits with Vectorworks’ monthly webinars. Whether you are a beginner or experienced designer, you can gain new skills, fine-tune workflows, and discover all you can do with Vectorworks.

Data-driven 3D Modeling for Interiors 

_Aired April 19_

With more technology available to interior and architectural designers, the traditional approach to developing commercial projects is moving to exciting levels.

Your workflow is no longer just about providing 2D drawings and details; great visualizations and smart take-offs can all be a part of your design process. BIM for interiors is a more thoughtful way to design, organize, and face today’s challenges in the industry.

In this presentation — inspired by an elegant retail interiors project located in Tokyo by designers Mana & Takashi Kobayashi, IMA Inc. — Luis M. Ruiz, Int. Assoc. AIA, will discuss how you can increase your efficiency and win more work with an integrated data-driven 3D modeling process.

This course is approved for one AIA LU, AIBC, AAA, ALBNL, AANB, NSAA, and OAA core learning hour.

###### Switching to Vectorworks for Live Events

_Aired on April 20_

Brian Wajda has an impressive 20-plus years in the live events industry, working as a producer, technical director, stage manager, show caller, and more. [In 2020 Wajda started his own production company, Ambitious Events, and switched to Vectorworks after years of using AutoCAD and progeCAD.](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/why-ambitious-events-chose-vectorworks.html)

In this webinar, Wajda will share why he switched to Vectorworks, the value of his onboarding process, and a walkthrough of some of his recent projects.

###### The Power of 3D Modeling

_Aired on April 21_

Visualizations are an integral facet of landscape design. Everyone has a different approach, from continuing to embrace the more time-intensive hand-drawn methods, while others utilize CAD paired with 3D modeling and image-editing technology. Although each of these are successful to some degree — revisions are inevitable, and the time it takes to reconstruct these illustrations in multiple software’s can be greatly reduced by fine-tuning the design in a single application.

Join us to witness the power and efficiencies gained by 3D modeling in Vectorworks Landmark and gain an understanding of how to build various features found on a proposed site while using a combination of landscape-specific tools and commonly used 3D modeling processes. Communication is essential for the success of any project, and the mention of “revisions” shouldn’t cause fear of going over budget.

This course is approved for one LA CES PDH and one APLD CEU.

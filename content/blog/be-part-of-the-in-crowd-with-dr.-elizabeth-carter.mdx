# Diversity & Inclusion Means Taking Action

“I always say that diversity is inviting someone to the party and inclusion is asking them to dance,” said Dr. Elizabeth Carter, who hosted a session at Vectorworks called “Be Part of the ‘In’ Crowd.”

As a Black woman and four-time bestselling author, Dr. Carter said she’s proud to be speaking on the topic. “Working in finance, there’s not a lot of people who look like me,” she said. “I look at the STEM industry as very under representative for various reasons. It’s why I think I thrive in this space. I really work to help more underrepresented individuals get into the industry and, separately, to allow them to learn and grow and move up.”

Her unifying message is what drew the [Vectorworks Diversity & Inclusion committee](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/get-to-know-the-vectorworks-diversity-and-inclusion-committee.html) to contact her about speaking with us.

“This session really was employee-driven,” said Emilee Romano, a Vectorworks employee and committee member. “The committee contacted Dr. Carter because we believed it would be a valuable conversation for all of us.”

The session began with a [Harvard Implicit Association Test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html), which is designed to get us to become aware of our implicit biases, a term Dr. Carter defined along with a few other important ones.

## Definitions

* **Inclusion** refers to the behaviors and social norms that ensure people feel welcome and empowered.
* **Equality** is ensuring that every individual has an equal opportunity to make the most of their lives and talents.
* **Equity** is giving more to those who need it.
* **Microaggression** refers to a comment or action that subtly and often unconsciously or unintentionally expresses a prejudiced attitude towards a member of a marginalized group.
* **Implicit bias** is the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner.

## Statistics

The numbers below prove Dr. Carter’s case that diversity, equity, and inclusion are crucial to successful business going forward.

* Non-whites will be the majority in both the USA and Europe [by the year 2050](https://culturalawareness.com/the-neuroscience-of-inclusion/).
* A shortage of skilled workers affecting 25 major economies — the US, Germany, Japan, Brazil, South Africa, and India, to name a few — [is a potential $10 trillion risk by 2030](https://culturalawareness.com/the-neuroscience-of-inclusion/).
* [Research shows](https://www.businessinsider.com/accenture-report-perception-gap-shows-economic-cost-lack-of-diversity-inclusion) that 98% of leaders think employees feel their company is inclusive, while only 80% of employees feel that way. Closing this “perception gap” could save employers millions and boost US company profits by a whopping $1.05 trillion.

Additionally, a 2002 study by Scott Page, PhD called Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences indicates that, given a set of diverse problem solvers, a random collection outperforms a collection of the “best” individual problem solvers. In other words, the more diverse group outperforms the group of the best “most of the time,” the study says, which has clear applications to business.

## How Vectorworks Is Taking Action

Dr. Carter encouraged us to think about ways in which Vectorworks could be more diverse, equitable, and inclusive. The most common idea was to refrain from collecting gender information on clients and those who purchase a Vectorworks license.

“The Diversity & Inclusion committee is excited by the opportunity to brainstorm with our employees to uncover things we should stop doing, keep doing, and start doing to be more inclusive, and then working with others within the company to share these ideas and help make those things happen,” Romano said. 

Other suggestions mentioned were a mentoring program to help employees from underrepresented groups, employee resource groups designated as safe spaces to learn about microaggressions without feeling pressured, and changing the way we collect gender information to be more inclusive.

“We’ve also implemented movie nights for all of Vectorworks to keep the energy going,” said Kristin Bailey, a Vectorworks employee and committee member. The selected movies, she explained, will revolve around poignant issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Each movie night is followed by a group discussion about how to implement what we learned at Vectorworks.

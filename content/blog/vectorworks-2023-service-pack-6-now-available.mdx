#### Vectorworks Architect

The [Solibri Inside](https://www.solibri.com/inside?utm%5Fcampaign=Solibri%2520Inside&utm%5Fsource=vectorworks) web palette, which is a great way to deliver quality designs, is now available to try directly in Vectorworks Architect and Design Suite products. The easy-to-use model checker captures errors as you design, letting you validate, report, and modify your building model within Vectorworks.

#### Interoperability

Vectorworks 2023 Service Pack 6 is certified for IFC4 Reference View 1.2.

And, to further improve your interoperability processes, you can now batch import multiple USD files as symbols. Service Pack 6 also resolves an issue with textures from imported USDZ files.

#### Vectorworks Landmark 

Grouped plant polygons and skirt geometry for the **3D mesh site model display mode** have been improved .

We’ve also enhanced [Laubwerk content in Vectorworks Landmark](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/vectorworks-laubwerk-will-improve-your-site-design-workflow.html):

* All models have been improved, including the quality of the low-polygon-count representations.
* Buddleja davidii (“Pablo Purple”) has been added.

#### ConnectCAD

There are also updates found in ConnectCAD, Vectorworks’ signal flow add-on.

A new option in the **Device Eyedropper Transfer Preferences** dialog box allows you to include the transfer of attached record data.

The **Edit Cabling** tool better handles complex cable networks, and the **Find-Replace Text** command now updates the device, equipment item, and rack frame names while maintaining correct object associations.

#### General

The update also improves support for **Favorites** in your **Resource Manager**. With this improved support, resources within **Favorites** are included in search results.

Files with special characters in their name are also now supported.

Additionally, Vectorworks 2023 Service Pack 6 boosts general stability when panning/zooming, and it restores Marionette nodes to their previous state after you perform an undo operation.

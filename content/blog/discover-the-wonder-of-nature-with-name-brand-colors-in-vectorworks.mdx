# Capture the Beauty of Nature with Name-Brand Colors in Vectorworks

You design spaces to make an impact.

And whether you’re trying to [promote wellness](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/how-wellness-has-become-key-in-post-pandemic-workspaces.html) or [create an inspirational workplace](https://www.vectorworks.net/customer-showcase/boosting-design-confidence-with-the-flexibility-of-bim), the right combination of layout, materiality, and color is essential. This blog will focus on the third of that essential trio and how you can use a custom color palette in Vectorworks to harness the beauty of nature and create impactful spaces.

## Name-Brand Paint Manufacturer’s Nature-Inspired Colors 

Whether you're going for a rustic, bohemian, or minimalist look, natural hues can seamlessly blend with any design scheme, adding depth and texture to your interiors. And this was likely something some of the biggest paint manufacturers were thinking of when they released their 2023 Color of the Year selections.

Some manufacturers like [Behr](https://www.behr.com/consumer/inspiration/2023-coty/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAq5meBhCyARIsAJrtdr652O1FDNmoYtKJnQi153jPc6Oz0I2uZ536VP8q%5FOj2-v3Z4u0ymnQaAqh6EALw%5FwcB&gclsrc=aw.ds), [Dulux Trade](https://www.duluxtradepaintexpert.co.uk/en/content/dulux-colour-of-the-year-2023), and [Sherwin Williams](https://www.sherwin-williams.com/en-us/color-of-the-year-2023?gclid=Cj0KCQiAq5meBhCyARIsAJrtdr6JCDQtsQejN7Is%5FqgNsfEej-LLMJq8mYBKBPE4o2Y%5Fsz2KbZOLfLEaAhDUEALw%5FwcB) selected neutral earth tones. Sherwin Williams, [a Vectorworks partner](https://www.vectorworks.net/community/partner-network/find-partner), picked Redend Point as their 2023 Color of the Year in an effort to “embrace a spirit of connection with the world around.”

But not all the selections are neutral browns and earth tones. There are rich, calming colors like [Glidden’s](https://www.glidden.com/trends) Vining Ivy and [Krylon’s](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221013005159/en/Krylon%C2%AE-Announces-2023-Color-of-the-Year-Spanish-Moss) Spanish Moss, for example. 

[Valspar](https://www.valspar.com/colors/colors-of-the-year) and [Pantone’s](https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year/2023) colors, on the other hand, are more vibrant and reminiscent of what you might find in a flowery garden or meadow.

On their website, Pantone said that Viva Magenta “is a shade rooted in nature descending from the red family and expressive of a new signal of strength. Viva Magenta is brave and fearless, and a pulsating color whose exuberance promotes a joyous and optimistic celebration, writing a new narrative.”

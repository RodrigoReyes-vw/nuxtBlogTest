# How to Use the Per Face Texture Mapping Feature in Vectorworks 2022

With the release of [Vectorworks 2022](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/vectorworks-2022-now-available-for-download.html), you now have access to a variety of tools that’ll help you _design without limits™._ Below are just some of the robust new features you can use in Vectorworks 2022:

* Full use of Metal on Mac and DirectX on Windows in the Vectorworks Graphics Module.
* A new Redshift render mode powered by [Redshift by Maxon](https://www.maxon.net/en/redshift).
* A new direct link to [Twinmotion](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/twinmotion).
* A redesign of the attribute and snapping palettes and new per-face texture mapping, which support an intuitive process for creating and visualizing designs.
* Updates to the worksheet database and Data Manager provide a consistent interface, better visual cues, a new search mode, and an improved formula bar with a new set of functions to help make generating targeted reports, schedules, and material take offs easy.
* Improvements to the stair tool for direct editing and modifying help simplify the process of [designing complex objects.](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/the-best-3d-modeling-for-interior-architecture.html)
* Re-engineering and modernization of core architectural objects like wall components and data reporting support the creation of accurate BIM models.

Read on to learn more about 2022's handy Per Face Texture Mapping feature. 

###### What's the Per Face Texture Mapping Feature?

Per Face Texture Mapping provides you with unique design flexibility when creating accurate visualization of solid modeled objects for anything from custom furniture to unique building facade systems.

With the Texture tool, you’re able to customize an object on a face-by-face basis. You also have the ability to adjust scale and rotation of your textures with a redesigned Render tab in the Object Info palette (OIP).

###### How Does Per Face Texture Mapping Work?

The Texture tool is located in the Basic tool set and includes four modes:

* Apply to Object.
* Apply to Face.
* Replace Matching Texture.
* Pick Up.

Once your geometry is created and you’re ready to modify texture, pick a texture from the pull-down list. With the “Apply to Object” or “Apply to Face” mode enabled, select the object, face, or faces you’d like to edit. The Render tab in the OIP will display the overall texture of an object, as well as any texture overrides that have been applied.

For even greater customization of your design, you can select the modified face(s) in the OIP. These face(s) will then be highlighted on the modeled object. And to further enhance the mapping of each face, you can control scale, rotation, and mapping type within the Render tab.

The third mode, “Replace Matching Texture,” allows you to replace all faces of an object sharing a similar texture with the active texture in the pull-down list. Such a capability will save you time when addressing the aesthetic details of your 3D models and renderings.

The final mode, “Pick Up,” will activate any selected texture and establish it as the default tool texture.

The Per Face Texture Mapping feature is sure to let you efficiently — and effectively — articulate your design vision to a client. Realistic details can make a client fall in love with your design.

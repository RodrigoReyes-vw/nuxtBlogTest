# Vectorworks Helps Student Designers Get 2 The Top

We are proud to have been involved in the latest [Society of British Interior Designers (SBID)](http://www.sbid.org/education/student-competition/) student competition and to be actively involved in their events. It is a privilege to participate in the various activities and competitions SBID holds for interior designers.

Each event held by the SBID helps to find the finest young designers and bridge the gap between students and their careers. By partnering with SBID, we are able to offer a wide array of opportunities for the interior designers of the future.

This year, we are supporting the [Get Me 2 the Top UK](http://www.sbid.org/education/student-competition-uk/) student competition, which is open to students studying interior design, or an equivalent major, in college. Our very own UK Director of Customer Success, Tamsin Slatter, was chosen to serve as a judge for this competition.

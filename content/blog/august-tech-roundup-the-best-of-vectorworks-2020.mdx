# August Tech Roundup: The Best of Vectorworks 2020

The end of August signals a new software release around the corner, but this doesn’t mean we say goodbye to [Vectorworks 2020](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/2020?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=082720techroundup). In fact, the power of our current version and its usability are key reasons to still talk about the benefits of its features, so you can make the most of your design time with Vectorworks. Here’s a look back at the best tech tips from Vectorworks 2020.

## The Launch

[Last September](/meet-vectorworks-2020-clearly-insightful.-simply-powerful?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=082720techroundup), Vectorworks 2020 arrived with a strong emphasis on data and usability. This focus brought improved design workflows with new features that delivered quality improvements and better BIM capabilities. Top features include:

## Managing Data Your Way

The Data Manager simplifies your BIM workflows by gathering all data in one place to define data mappings and create data sheets from the same dialog. With this feature, you’re able to create your own workflow based on your needs, requirements, and processes.

_Bonus tip_: This feature combined with the [Data Visualization](https://university.vectorworks.net/mod/scorm/player.php?scoid=282&cm=356&currentorg=articulate%5Frise?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=082720techroundup) capabilities gives you efficient quality control of building information models with Vectorworks.

## More Performance Improvements and Key Updates

In March, we released [Service Pack 3](/introducing-service-pack-3-what-it-means-for-you?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=082720techroundup) for Vectorworks 2020 which brought quality and performance enhancements, along with new partner integrations.

The new real-time rendering connection available through [Enscape](https://enscape3d.com/) allows Windows users to quickly produce high-quality, compelling live-linked renderings in their Vectorworks model. 

_Bonus tip_: The Enscape free beta is available to users through October 2020.

Additionally, improved [GDTF data workflows](/gdtf-becomes-entertainment-standard-with-din-spec-15800?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=082720techroundup) allow files to be directly imported into [Spotlight](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/spotlight?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=082720techroundup) and managed directly from the Resource Manager.

The NBS Chorus integration allows you to manage, modify, and verify BIM specifications. Users can open a web palette in Vectorworks, letting them work concurrently with their model and NBS Chorus. 

_Bonus tip:_ An active [Vectorworks Service Select](https://www.vectorworks.net/service-select?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=082720techroundup) membership is required for this function.

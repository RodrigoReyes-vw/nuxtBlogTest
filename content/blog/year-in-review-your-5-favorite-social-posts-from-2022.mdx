# Year in Review | Your 5 Favorite Social Posts from 2022

Season’s greetings, everyone!

As the end of 2022 approaches, let’s look back at a few projects from the year that are nothing short of Instagrammable — and believe it or not, [that’s a real word](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/new-words-in-the-dictionary-september-2018).

In this blog article, you’ll see our 5 favorite Instagram posts from 2022, with a little insight into what makes the projects so fascinating.

## #1 – Lollapalooza Brazil

Erich Bertti and Victor Auricchio [created some showstopping designs for the Lollapalooza festival in Brazil](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/lollapalooza-brazil-lighting-design.html). The designers shared drawings and models with us so we could show off their work, and we can’t thank them enough.

It’s always great to see what designers are doing with Vectorworks Spotlight. This post is one of our favorites because of the project’s intricate stage design that matches up perfectly with what was built. Additionally, the lighting design will drop your jaw — check out the Instagram post for more photos!

## **#2 – Kid Cudi’s Moon Man’s Landing Festival**

As time goes on, event designs are growing more and more… out of this world?

We love this project because it really emphasizes our design without limits tagline. Creating the spaceship that’s hoisted in mid-air at center stage required tons of technical precision, especially when you consider how perfectly it was modeled within Vectorworks Spotlight.

## **#3 – Andrew Chu for The Mighty Ducks on Disney+**

Have you ever had to work on a tight deadline? Andrew Chu and his team at Alternating Current were able to develop a gala for the Disney+ series, The Mighty Ducks, in just one day. This story is amazing because it proves how efficient you can be with Vectorworks Spotlight. The company syncs Vectorworks Spotlight with Lightwright for a seamless workflow.

## **#4 – “The Lacey” Washington D.C. Residential Building**

We love sharing before-and-after images because it’s so inspiring to see how Vectorworks drawings and models translate into the real world.

“The Lacey,” a modern residential building in Washington D.C., showcases architecture that’s both thoughtful and beautiful. Common areas have an open design that encourages meetups between neighbors. Natural light is plentiful via the large east and west -facing windows.

## **#5 – Historic English Cottage Landscape by Acres Wild**

This project shows off a different side of Vectorworks than the others mentioned in this post: the ability to manage a design project even in the early conceptual stages. 

The design is for a garden for a historic English cottage. Acres Wild Garden design began sketching by hand, then imported their drawings into Vectorworks to trade, detail, and eventually model the project. The Instagram post also shows some examples of how the designers applied stylized treatments to their models and drawings, giving them a brand identity.

# Live Coffee Breaks Now Available to All Vectorworks Customers

You read that headline correctly! Vectorworks Coffee Breaks are no longer available to only Service Select members. Get your fix of caffeine and Vectorworks alike.

## What are Vectorworks Coffee Breaks?

Vectorworks Coffee Breaks are short, casual online sessions that give you the opportunity to learn about different Vectorworks topics. You'll also be able to interact with Vectorworks trainers and ask questions throughout the sessions. Coffee Breaks are 100% online, so you can add to your skills without leaving your desk.

Below are three of the many great Coffee Breaks we've already held:

* [The Stair Tool](https://university.vectorworks.net/course/view.php?id=1929)
* [Data Tags](https://university.vectorworks.net/course/view.php?id=268)
* [Alligned Hardscapes and Landscape Areas with a Site Model](https://university.vectorworks.net/course/view.php?id=1658)

## When Will Vectorworks Coffee Breaks Take Place?

At least two coffee breaks are offered per month, every other Thursday. Additionally, these sessions will be offered twice on their scheduled day to include as many time zones as possible. Coffee Breaks for the architecture, interior, landscape, and entertainment design industries have already been — and will continue to be — offered. Topics more general to our software and its capabilities are also offered.

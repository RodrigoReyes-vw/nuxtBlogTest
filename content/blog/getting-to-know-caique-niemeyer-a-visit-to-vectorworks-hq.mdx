# Getting to Know Caique Niemeyer: A Visit to Vectorworks HQ 

Getting to know the designers who use Vectorworks is one of the best parts of what we do. Last week, we had the privilege of hosting Caique Niemeyer of [Caique Niemeyer Arquitetura & Design](https://www.facebook.com/pg/caiqueniemeyer/photos/?ref=page%5Finternal) at our headquarters in Columbia, Maryland. Caique Niemeyer is the great-grandson of prominent architect Oscar Niemeyer, a pioneer of modernist architecture known for his designs of the buildings of Brasília, Brazil’s capital city.

Caique recently switched from using AutoCAD to using Vectorworks for his designs, models, and plans. To advance his Vectorworks skills, he spent some time in a training session with our architectural industry product specialists. The session focused on 3D modeling tools and site modeling tools, including demonstrations on how to bring in georeferenced data from a surveyor directly into Vectorworks, how to use data to create a property line, and how to create a digital terrain site model.

Senior Architect Product Specialist Juan Carlos Fabbiani, AIA, said it was surprising to learn how Caique worked with AutoCAD in the past. He would take hand drawings, translate the elevations into AutoCAD, and then translate every level into a plan. “While he was showing me his former workflow in AutoCAD, we both agreed it was a long and tedious process to get the plans out of the elevations,” says Fabbiani. “Now with Vectorworks, he can do all of this directly from the model in an efficient way.”

We ended the day with a happy hour — a great opportunity for more of the Vectorworks team to get to know Caique Niemeyer and his work.

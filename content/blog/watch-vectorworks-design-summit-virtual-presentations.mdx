# WATCH: Vectorworks Design Summit Virtual Presentations

You’ve likely heard that [we’ve cancelled our Vectorworks Design Summit](/vectorworks-design-summit-cancelled-due-to-coronavirus-concerns?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=button&utm%5Fcontent=042320summitkeynote) due to COVID-19\. This decision comes with a heavy heart—but, even though we can’t be together in person, we still believe in the value the event brings to our users.

That’s why we’ve put together a virtual presentation by our CEO, Dr. Biplab Sarkar. In lieu of a standard in-person presentation, Dr. Sarkar will give this virtual keynote as a kickoff, a veritable start-your-engines to ring in the Design Summit. This keynote as well as other speaker presentations are available to you now, on-demand.

Dr. Sarkar covers a variety of topics, including partnerships, business strategies for 2020 and beyond, Vectorworks’ continued focus on BIM, and more. Check it out now, and celebrate the Design Summit with us as best we can!

That’s not all—we’ve also released industry-specific presentations by our product experts.

Our architecture presentation is by Vectorworks Product Marketing Director, Rubina Siddiqui, Assoc. AIA.

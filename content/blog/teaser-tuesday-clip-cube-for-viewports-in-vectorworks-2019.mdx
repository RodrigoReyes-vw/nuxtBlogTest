# Teaser Tuesday: Clip Cube for Viewports in Vectorworks 2019

The upcoming feature we are showcasing today is likely to be a crowd pleaser. In Vectorworks 2019, we are introducing clip cube support for viewports and [Renderworks](https://www.vectorworks.net/products/features/renderworks?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=teasertuesday090318) modes in design layers and sheet layers.

This new ability is one that users requested using our wish list forum. Previously, clip cube supported openGL and WireFrame rendering modes. However, now you will be able to use clip cubes in any rendered view or style, giving you the efficiency and capability you need to create remarkable sections, elevations, and presentation drawings. 

The clip cube option is located in the advanced viewport dialog box, along with other preferences, such as changing the fill and edge color or casting shadows of removed objects. To get the full details check out the video below.

“The new clip cube feature is great. We’ve been waiting for the ability to show clip cubes in sheet layer viewports, and now we can," said Chad Hamilton, AIA, LEED, AP, principal architect at Hamilton + Aitken Architects. “In schematic design, we can make 3D plan views by setting clip cube a few feet above the floor. Or in design development, we can present sections in cutaway axon views to really demonstrate how things relate to each other. This really expands our tools for design presentations."

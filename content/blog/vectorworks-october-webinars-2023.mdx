# October Webinars | Now Available On Demand

For many, October is a month for horror films, costume parties, and other spooky endeavors.

Vectorworks’ webinars, however, aren’t scary at all. Take a look at October's on-demand offerings of design techniques and perspectives that will help further your career.

#### USING DESIGN TECHNOLOGY FOR WATER-CONSCIOUS LANDSAPES

_Aired October 4 | Approved for one LA CES PDH and APLD CEU_

Designing landscapes with sustainability in mind is no longer a matter of preference but one of meeting jurisdictional requirements.   
  
Site designers can harness the power of design software, online resources, and other digital tools to meet new expectations in water-efficient irrigation and on-site water management. And with the help of GIS integrations, plant databases, and smart 2D/3D object design, creatively managing water in your proposed landscape is easier than ever.

#### Increased efficiency with site analysis tools

_Aired October 12 | Approved for one LA CES PDH and APLD CEU_

Site analysis tools and technologies can boost your workflow efficiencies from design to installation.

Join Joe Hanauer, registered landscape architect, and owner of Landscape Architecture, LLC., for a webinar on how to use design software and other apps and hardware to collect information, synthesize the data, and communicate ideas to customers.

Hanauer will also cover the integration of complementary technologies used to collect site data. Save time site surveying, creating base information and increase the accuracy of design projects.

#### Collaborative Theatre Design with Vectorworks

_Aired October 26_

With a request of little-to-no technical equipment in sight and the production taking place in a small venue, transferring Daniel Fish’s version of the classic musical _Oklahoma!_ from Broadway to the West End was never going to be easy. Set designer Grace Laubacher led a design team to bring the project to life with 3D modelling and Project Sharing in Vectorworks. 

Join Grace Laubacher (set designer), Fridthjofur Thorsteinsson (associate lighting designer), Drew Levy (sound designer), and Josh Thorson (video designer) for a webinar on how Vectorworks helped create one of the smoothest collaborations the team has ever been through.

# June Tech Roundup: 2 New Courses for ConnectCAD

Since the [launch of ConnectCAD 2020](/connectcad2020-hits-entertainment-market?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=062520techroundup), new courses were added to [Vectorworks University](https://university.vectorworks.net/?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=062520techroundup) to make your workflow much easier and efficient. Read on for this month's tech tips.

###### Custom Fields

In previous versions, users were able to add their own custom fields to ConnectCAD objects. However, it was challenging to migrate these customizations to new versions when upgrading. This is no longer a problem in [ConnectCAD 2020](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/connectcad?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=062520techroundup). Follow this step-by-step course and learn how to visualize and add to your custom fields.

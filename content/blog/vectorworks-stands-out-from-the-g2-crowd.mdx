The reviews are in, and [G2 Crowd](https://www.g2crowd.com/) users have spoken. The world’s leading business solutions review website, featured us in its Spring 2018 Grid and Index reports.

The reports rank software based on unbiased and real-time reviews from verified users. Specifically, [Vectorworks Architect](http://www.vectorworks.net/architect?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=g2crowd042618) was ranked second in the “[Highest Rated](https://www.g2crowd.com/categories/building-design-and-building-information-modeling-bim#highest%5Frated)” and “[Easiest To Use](https://www.g2crowd.com/categories/building-design-and-building-information-modeling-bim#easiest%5Fto%5Fuse)” categories for Building Design and Building Information Modeling (BIM) software. Scoring ahead of other BIM software programs, Architect received a 92 percent satisfaction score and an 8.5 usability score.

_Vectorworks Architect receives a 92% satisfaction score from G2 Crowd._ 

According to G2 Crowd, a product’s satisfaction and usability scores are calculated by a proprietary algorithm that factors in review data from actual users. Software buyers can compare products according to their satisfaction scores to streamline the buying process and quickly identify the best products based on the experiences of their peers. 

“It is an honor to have Vectorworks Architect recognized by G2 Crowd, but this wouldn’t be possible without the support of our amazing users,” said Dan Monaghan, vice president of marketing at Vectorworks. “They are the ones who keep us motivated in our mission to offer the best BIM software for the AEC industry year after year.”

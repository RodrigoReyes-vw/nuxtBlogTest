###### Amplify Change: Designers as Sounding Boards

"Design thinking can be applied to everyday activism. As creative problem solvers, we catalyze change by improving the environments where people live, work, and play," says Eastlake Studio. "We can extend this momentum beyond billable work to volunteer activities that promote social justice."  
  
The studio goes on to say, "This session will reveal how you can leverage resources and apply professional skills in the context of community engagement. Using Eastlake Studio's Sounding Boards as a case study, the discussion will explore how individual designers and firms can amplify change using the tools of our trade."

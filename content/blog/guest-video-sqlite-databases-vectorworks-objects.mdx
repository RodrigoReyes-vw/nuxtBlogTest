# Leveraging Vectorworks Object Data with SQLite Databases

_This blog and video are from Marc Davies, a former furniture design advisor for the UK Department for Education. Davies recently worked for a UK interior and data visualization company for a diverse clientele across UK universities and government departments._ 

_A long-standing Vectorworks customer and product designer, Davies searches for efficient and effective methods of information delivery for client organizations, combining Vectorworks with Claris Filemaker Pro and, more recently, SQLite databases_.

. . .

This video covers the essentials of connecting parametric objects in Vectorworks to SQLite databases, enabling you to set up links to external data via a lookup ID code (a “Primary Key” in SQLite terms). It shows:

* How to set up the external database
* How to connect objects in a Vectorworks drawing by ID code to the external database
* How to bring the external data into the drawn objects within the Vectorworks drawing

# Design. Submit. Win. — No, Seriously, It’s That Easy

You put your all into your schoolwork, so why not get rewarded for it?

We’re not just talking about an A on a project, either. The prize for the annual Vectorworks Design Scholarship is up to $10,000 USD, professional recognition, and an addition to your resume that proves your designs are a step above the rest.

Starting on December 1, the Vectorworks Design Scholarship opens for undergraduate and graduate students all over the world in [majors](https://www.vectorworks.net/scholarship/resources?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=120120scholarship) related to architecture, landscape architecture and design, entertainment, and interior design fields to submit recent, completed work. You can submit your designs until March 31, 2021, at which point they will go through two rounds of review by our esteemed panel of judges. [Judging criteria](https://www.vectorworks.net/ebooks/scholarship-rubric-eng-us?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=120120scholarship) are as follows:

* Design
* Technology
* Concept & originality
* Presentation, and
* Communication of design vision.

Sounds pretty easy, right?

All you have to do now is complete the simple application. Give us a quick description of the heart of your individual or group project and attach your work. After that, you can relax until winners are announced on June 16, 2021.

First-round winners in the US will receive $3,000 USD\* for tuition, fees, housing, textbooks, you name it — if it’s for school it likely qualifies! Not to mention you’ll also benefit your classmates by winning _free_ [Vectorworks design software](https://www.vectorworks.net/designer?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=120120scholarship) for your school and free virtual training for faculty and students.

First-round winners will then be automatically entered into the second round where they may win the grand prize Richard Diehl Award, which is an additional $7,000 USD and the added design software for their school and training for faculty and students.

“I entered the Vectorworks Design Scholarship to demonstrate my ability to design a stage, present it with clarity, create video content, find audio tracks and show off all my skills in software like After Effects, Vision, and MAonPC,” said Kristopher Clemson, founder of [Bifröst Lighting LLC](http://www.bifrostlighting.com/) and last year’s first entertainment [Richard Diehl award winner](https://www.vectorworks.net/scholarship/past-winners?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=120120scholarship).

“Winning the scholarship helped to get my career started and I encourage all students to enter the contest because not only is the scholarship money helpful, but it’s also an amazing opportunity to get your foot in the door into your industry, whether you attend a well-known school or not.”

# Recap: 4 Architecture Webinars You Need to See

Vectorworks University is one the several resources at your fingertips that will help you design without limits. With free webinars, tech tips, and more, you’ll be able to expand your skills, perfect your workflows, and optimize your software for your creative process.

Let’s look back at some of the architecture webinars you may have missed this year.

## 1\. Sustainable Resources for Small-Scale BIM

![blog-1440x800_BLDG October Webinar](https://blog.vectorworks.net/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/221020_October%20Webinar%20Blog/blog-1440x800_BLDG%20October%20Webinar.png?width=1440&height=800&name=blog-1440x800_BLDG%20October%20Webinar.png)

This session’s goal is to show you and allied design professionals how the inherently data-rich nature of building information modeling can serve smaller, design-oriented projects just as effectively as it does larger projects.

This webinar will help you:

* Learn about quantitative BIM design opportunities and the value of applying them to a resource-efficient design process
* Understand how building design information can be a powerful foundation for an architectural response to material and resource use
* Identify the applicability of BIM tools and workflows to achieve project goals for sustainable resource use and building performance
* Learn about specific cases demonstrating BIM’s role in the optimized design of material-efficient, high-performance buildings

[Click here to watch “Sustainable Resources for Small-Scale BIM](https://university.vectorworks.net/course/view.php?id=2347)[”](https://university.vectorworks.net/course/view.php?id=2347), and [here to read a blog about a project by the presenter, François Lévy](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/inclusive-architecture-mikes-house-by-françois-lévy.html), AIA, NCARB, AIAA.

This course is approved for 1 AIA LU, 1 Core AIBC LU, 1 Core AAA Learning Hour, and 1 AANB, ALBNL, NSAA Core Learning Credit.

## 2\. Rendering for Everyday Architectural Drawing

![Feb Webinar 1](https://blog.vectorworks.net/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/220217_Feb%20Webinar/Feb%20Webinar%201.jpg?width=1680&height=945&name=Feb%20Webinar%201.jpg)

Looking for a crash course in how to impress clients with your architectural drawings? Then this is the webinar for you.

This webinar will help you:

* Define basic rendering techniques for creating typical architectural views (i.e. plans, sections, elevations)
* Evaluate the uses of surface hatches as material textures applied to external building surfaces with hidden line renders in everyday workflows
* Examine the applications of foreground renders versus background renders in viewports
* Explore the additional features available in rendering software (i.e. gradients, transparencies, Image Effects, etc.)

This course is approved for 1 AIA LU, 1 AIBC Core LU, and 1.0 AAA Structured LH.

## 3\. Algorithmic Design in BIM Software

![0202-blog-images-resize-feb-webinar-arch](https://blog.vectorworks.net/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/210225_February%20Tech%20Round-Up/0202-blog-images-resize-feb-webinar-arch.jpg?width=1440&height=800&name=0202-blog-images-resize-feb-webinar-arch.jpg)

If you haven’t had the chance to get familiar with Vectorworks’ algorithmic modeling tool, Marionette, this webinar is the place to start.

This webinar will help you:

* Identify the multiple benefits of using algorithmic modeling within a design and BIM software
* Describe how algorithmic modeling can be used to create multiple iterations and increase time efficiency within the design process
* Demonstrate how algorithmic modeling can be used to analyze data and optimize designs
* Discover how designers are currently using algorithmic modeling in their designs

This course is approved for 1 AIA LU.

## 4\. Understanding Your Project’s Carbon Footprint

![VECC 100kb for VWU](https://blog.vectorworks.net/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/220315_March%20Webinars/VECC%20100kb%20for%20VWU.jpg?width=1680&height=945&name=VECC%20100kb%20for%20VWU.jpg)

You all must’ve heard that buildings account for a huge percentage of global carbon emissions, because this webinar rounds out our list of your favorites of the year.

This webinar will help you:

* Understand the concept of embodied carbon and whole life cycle carbon assessment
* Recognize the project lifecycle stages
* Learn types of carbon data sources and Environmental Product Declarations (EPD)
* Embrace the methods of embodied carbon calculation and data visualization

[Click here to watch “Understanding Your Project’s Carbon Footprint,”](https://university.vectorworks.net/course/view.php?id=2043) and [here for a blog post about the Vectorworks Embodied Carbon Calculator.](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/calculate-embodied-carbon-with-this-vectorworks-worksheet.html)

This course is approved for 1 AIA LU, 1 AIBC Core LU, and 1.0 AAA Structured LH.

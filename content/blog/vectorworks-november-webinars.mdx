# November Webinars | Now Available On Demand

Look to Vectorworks’ November webinars for valuable insights into your design workflows. Topics include data-driven documentation, House of Worship production, the Vectorworks Embodied Carbon Calculator, and the use of Civil 3D files.

Learn more about the webinars and how you can watch on demand below.

#### Data-Driven Documentation

_Aired November 14 | Approved for One AIA LU_

Spend more time designing and less time documenting using Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows and smart documentation tools. 

In this webinar, Sarah Barrett, associate AIA and senior architect product specialist at Vectorworks, discusses how data visualization and Data Tags can help document your model efficiently.

Watch this webinar to gain valuable insights on tools like **Viewport Styles**, **Graphic Legends**, **Grid Lines**, and **Elevation Benchmarks** to maximize your data automation and leverage smart tools for documentation.

#### Understanding your project's carbon footprint

_Aired November 29 | Approved for One Hour of Formal CPD_

The Vectorworks Embodied Carbon Calculator (VECC) provides you with the ability to assess embodied carbon emissions through a project’s lifecycle. The analysis looks at individual materials, a project’s lifecycle stages, and benchmarks for set targets.

During the webinar, you'll hear of standards, guidance, and legislation that drive embodied carbon to the front of the sustainable construction conversation. Presenter Luka Stefanovic, senior architecture industry specialist, demonstrates assessing the carbon footprint of a design with built-in tools that enable regular evaluations during the design process.

Troy Diamond, technical support specialist, RAIA, hosts the webinar and a brief Q&A on how VECC can be utilized for Australian workflows.

With the Vectorworks Embodied Carbon Calculator, you’ll have the power to gather metrics and make informed decisions as you look to achieve carbon-reducing targets.

#### Better Collaboration with Civil 3D Files

_Aired November 30 | Approved for One LA CES PDH and One APLD CEU_

As a landscape architect or designer, you can find efficiencies in making use of “background” files from civil and survey engineers. You can apply their proposed work without recreating the base plan. And, with advancements in BIM software, working in different applications is easier than ever before with better file management and staying consistent with origin, georeferencing, and positioning.   
  
Watch Tony Kostreski, PLA and senior landscape product specialist, to learn the benefits of importing or referencing files and how imported geometry and data can be transformed into smart hybrid objects. All of the methods discussed can provide essential context in your BIM for landscape workflows.

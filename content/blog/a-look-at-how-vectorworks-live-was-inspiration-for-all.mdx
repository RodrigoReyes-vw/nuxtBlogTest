# A Look at How Vectorworks Live was Inspiration for All

On November 30, 2018, our Japanese distributor [A&A Co., LTD.](http://www.aanda.co.jp/) hosted the [Vectorworks Live event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrRZPxZtStM) to reveal Vectorworks 2019 to the Japanese market. More than 300 attendees gathered at the Shinagawa Grand Hall in Tokyo alongside representatives from Vectorworks headquarters to witness how the latest features can enhance Japanese designs.

“It was a thrill and a privilege to be a part of Vectorworks Live in Tokyo—a wonderful event in an incredible city,” said Vectorworks VP of Product Development Steve Johnson. “It is extra special to celebrate in Japan with our customers and our long-standing partners at A&A.”

“This was a great opportunity for us to meet our customers in Japan and see first-hand the projects they are working on,” said Vectorworks VP of Product Management Darick DeHart.

Among the many presentations about the latest 2019 features in [Vectorworks Architect](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/architect?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=japanevent011719), [Landmark](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/landmark?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=japanevent011719), [Spotlight](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/spotlight?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=japanevent011719), and [Fundamentals](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/fundamentals?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=japanevent011719), Vectorworks CEO Dr. Biplab Sarkar talked about the current status of Vectorworks, with Johnson and DeHart sharing their plans for core technologies and the design series in future releases.

“We chose to show how an interior commercial project can be created by applying different modeling techniques,” said Ruiz. “We focused on the importance of lighting sources, materials, and the different types of output options for creating professional renderings, presentation boards, and the advantages of integrating new features, such as 3D rendered panoramas and cloud technology to their daily workflows.”

Based on comments from the audience, Ruiz’s presentation inspired many attendees and got them excited to try Vectorworks 2019.

“I thoroughly enjoyed being able to meet directly with our customers and see the wonderful designs they do with Vectorworks,” said Johnson. “It was inspiring and informative—the perfect opportunity to listen carefully and to learn how we can serve our customers even better.”

“It was a great honor to meet such talented designers like Hiroshi Haraguchi-san and Toshiya Izumi-san,” said Ruiz. “During the event, we could feel the enthusiasm for the new Vectorworks 2019 release. It was also great to be there to show existing users and prospects all the possibilities and benefits that they can achieve doing 3D with Vectorworks.”

Dr. Sarkar reflected on the event with similar thoughts.

“Attending the A&A launch event every year is very special for us as we get to describe the design trends and discuss innovative ideas in front of a wide cross-section of Japanese users,” said Sarkar. “Being one of the most popular CAD/BIM programs in Japan, it is our responsibility to present the future of Vectorworks as a company and as a product.”

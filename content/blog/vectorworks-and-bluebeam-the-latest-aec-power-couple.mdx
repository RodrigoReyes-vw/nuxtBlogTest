Project review and approval is now fast, easy, and paperless! We have partnered with [Bluebeam, Inc.](https://www.bluebeam.com/au), a leading developer of innovative technology solutions for the AEC industries, to bring a new integration between [Vectorworks Cloud Services](http://www.vectorworks.net/cloud-services?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=bluebeam03192018) and Bluebeam Studio, which supports a modern, online review and approval process for digital construction drawings and 3D models.

What’s more, we are the first BIM software company to connect our cloud services via the Bluebeam Studio API, allowing project team members to host real-time, online markups and review sessions.

The new integration creates a streamlined, cloud-based process for designers, architects, contractors, and owners to collaborate on PDF drawings and models. Vectorworks users can publish drawing sets as data-rich 2D PDFs or models as 3D PDFs to Vectorworks Cloud Services, where they can launch a Bluebeam Studio Session and then invite participants to compare, mark up, and collaborate in real time using the tools in Bluebeam Revu. Marked-up PDFs can then be saved back to Vectorworks Cloud Services for easy storage and file management.

“In a traditional drawing review process, PDF files are typically exchanged by email, then printed and manually marked up,” said Daniel Monaghan, VP of marketing at Vectorworks. “By moving to a cloud-based review workflow, collaboration among project team members becomes easier and helps avoid mistakes, and ultimately allows projects to run more smoothly by reducing review time and costs. By making it easy to share and review files digitally, we’re helping to connect design and construction workflows in ways no other BIM program can offer.”

This new integration is available at no charge to all Vectorworks Service Select maintenance program members. A Bluebeam Studio Prime subscription is required to enable the integration with Bluebeam Studio.

# June Webinars: BIM, Data-Driven Documentation, & House of Worship Market

Continue your education and earn accreditation with Vectorworks’ monthly webinars. Whether you are a beginner or experienced designer, you can gain new skills, fine\-tune workflows, and discover all you can do with Vectorworks. The more you know, the more you can create with Vectorworks.

## Architecture | Streamlining Workflows for Data-Driven Documentation

_Tuesday, June 15 | 2 pm EST_

Spend more time designing and less time documenting by transitioning from a 2D to a 3D workflow. The benefits go beyond visualization aspects of 3D modeling. Creating a Building Information Model (BIM) will allow you to largely automate your workflow because BIM objects have built-in data that can be extracted using documentation tools. Sarah Barrett, Associate AIA and Senior Architect Product Specialist of Vectorworks will be explaining the purposes of the tools as well as how to efficiently document your model. Join this webinar to maximize your data automation and leverage smart tools for documentation and drawing. 

This course is approved for 1 AIA LU elective. Also, attendees who are members of Canadian Associations AIBC, AAA, AANB, ALBNL, and NSAA are eligible for 1 core learning hour/unit.

## Landscapes | The World According to BIM

_Thursday, June 24 | 2 pm EST_

Everyone is talking about BIM – big BIM, small BIM, BIM level 2\. But what should you think of before you start on your BIM journey? By making sure your project is in order, with the right structure and 

knowledge, you can make the transition into the World of BIM a whole lot easier. This webinar is focusing on the resources and structure you will be grateful to have in place when you approach your first BIM Execution Plan – it will show you how and why you should have templates prepared, how to work with libraries of resources, and how to ensure that you use all of Vectorworks’ tools when it comes to placing your project in the real world with help of GIS.

## Entertainment | Evolving the House of Worship Market

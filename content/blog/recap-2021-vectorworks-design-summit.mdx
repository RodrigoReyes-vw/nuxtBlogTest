# Design Summit 2021 | Relive the Virtual Event

Design Summit 2021 has come and gone. The three-day virtual event was our most-attended Design Summit to date! It was certainly an event to remember.

Let‚Äôs summarize!

###### Design Summit 2021 Keynote Presentations

Day one showcased three keynote presentations from Vectorworks leadership as well as a live Q&A. All this content is available to rewatch on the event site.

###### Dr. Biplab Sarkar, Chief Executive Officer

CEO Dr. Biplab Sarkar gave a keynote titled "Design without Limits" ‚Äî he talked about how Vectorworks both as a software and as an organization encourage your creative ideas without software limitations.

‚ÄúAt Vectorworks, we aim to alleviate constraints to your creativity,‚Äù Sarkar said. ‚ÄúWe believe your tools should never limit you or your creativity. You should be free from restrictive software that doesn‚Äôt understand what you want to create.‚Äù

###### Rubina Siddiqui, Product Marketing Director

Siddiqui, herself an architect, presented on building information modeling (BIM) and its essential position to Vectorworks and its industries.

‚ÄúWe at Vectorworks understand that BIM is the key to designers‚Äô success both now and in the future,‚Äù Siddiqui said.

[A more informed design process comes with huge benefits](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/simple-bim-for-the-project-architect.html). We won‚Äôt get into them here; you can hear more in the presentation! üôÇ

###### Steve Johnson, Chief Technology Officer

Johnson presented on the future of Vectorworks development and highlighted many [Vectorworks 2022 features that pave the road for technology advancements in the future](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/6-next-gen-tech-features-in-vectorworks-2022.html).

###### Design Summit 2021 Open House

We brought back the Open House by popular demand!

Day three of Design Summit featured Open House Zoom rooms on a variety of topics. The rooms were free for registrants to enter and chat with Vectorworks staff, industry experts, and technology partners/exhibitors from the Vectorworks Partner Network.

The room topics were:

* Architecture & BIM.
* Landscapes, BIM, & GIS.
* Entertainment
* Cloud & mobile.
* 3D modeling.
* Rendering.
* Vectorworks University & certifications.
* Roadmap.

Plus, rooms dedicated to partner products:

* Enscape.
* Solibri.
* MA Lighting.
* Interiorcad.
* Maxon.
* Siemens.
* Twinmotion.
* Lumion.

This was live content, so there‚Äôs nothing to go back and watch ‚Äî do keep in mind, though, that Open Houses are one of our favorite ways to have conversations with the Vectorworks community! You can certainly expect more events like this in the future.

Our other favorite way to gather feedback is on the public development roadmap, where you can share your thoughts about development tasks we‚Äôre working on.

###### A Comment on Virtual Events

This was our sixth Design Summit and the second time we‚Äôve hosted it virtually.

Though past Design Summits extended a global invitation, a majority of those who attended the in-person events came from the United States. Around 50% of all registrants for this virtual Design Summit were located outside of the US.

This speaks to the practicality of virtual and hybrid events ‚Äî an online component removes transportation and lodging barriers and is overall more convenient for a lot of the Vectorworks community.

And, critically, a virtual platform is a great forum for the Vectorworks community to engage directly with developers and decision makers at Vectorworks. 

###### Last Chance to Get Vectorworks Swag

We also opened a webpage with Vectorworks merchandise available for purchase.

The swag store is the place to go to represent your favorite design software! From clothing to branded accessories like stickers and notebooks, there‚Äôs sure to be something for you.

Swag is only available while supplies last ‚Äî check the page and see if anything appeals to you!

[![VISIT THE SWAG STORE](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/3018241/affc6ab4-1308-4322-ba22-46ef545983a4.png)](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/3018241/affc6ab4-1308-4322-ba22-46ef545983a4)

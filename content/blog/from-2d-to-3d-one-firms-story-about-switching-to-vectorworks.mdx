# From 2D to 3D: One Firm’s Story about Switching to Vectorworks

The best way to know that a product is right for you is trying it for yourself. The second-best way is hearing it from someone else.

Meet [Stagestruck](https://stagestruck.com/), a full-service entertainment production firm from the UK. A couple years ago, they were in search of a 3D design solution to help them better meet client needs. [Vectorworks Spotlight](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/spotlight?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=stagestruck050720) fit the bill.

See how Vectorworks Spotlight was able to beat out competitors like AutoCAD, Revit, and SketchUp with features such as:

* Import of laser-scanned point cloud files.
* Project Sharing capabilities.
* Expansive 3D modeling capabilities.
* And more!

“The switch is opening up a lot of doors,” said Tom Cordory, head of technical project management at Stagestruck. 

“I think it’s quite exciting for us as a business to know there's a lot of potential for us to get more out of the software and to grow how we're working proactively,” he continued. “It's exciting. We're excited about it. It's not very often you get excited about a piece of software.”

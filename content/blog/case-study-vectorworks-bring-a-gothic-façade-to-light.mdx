# Case Study: Vectorworks Brings a Gothic Fa√ßade to Light

Once again, [Spotlight](https://www.vectorworks.net/en/spotlight?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=swedishoperahouse111318) proved to be a time saver and collaboration facilitator. Isak Gabre, the former systems and project manager at the [Royal Swedish Opera](https://www.operan.se/), recently used our software to create a gothic video projection to coincide with the opening of [Dracula](https://www.operan.se/repertoarsida/dracula/) at the opera house. You can read more about his success on our website.

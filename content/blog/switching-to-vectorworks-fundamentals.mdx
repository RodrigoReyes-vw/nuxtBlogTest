# How to Switch to Vectorworks Fundamentals

[Vectorworks Fundamentals](https://www.vectorworks.net/fundamentals) gives you the freedom to imagine, design, and document all your design ideas. 

Despite your limitless design possibilities, a transition to Vectorworks Fundamentals is easier than you might think. In fact, you can switch in five, easy steps. 

Read on to learn more.

## What’s Vectorworks Fundamentals?

Before we dive into switching to Vectorworks Fundamentals, let’s review what the software is and what it can be used for. 

Simply put, Fundamentals is a powerful design software that allows you to create general drawings, 3D models, and document all in one software. The product is perfect for professions like product designers who need a robust modeling tool that's centered around flexible, yet accurate, free-form modeling and drawing.

Now, let’s review the five steps towards getting started with Vectorworks Fundamentals.

### Step 1 | Get Started with a Free Trial

Taking Vectorworks for a trial run is like test driving a car before you buy it. The difference with a software trial is that you have the time to freely explore the program in-depth.

Getting started with a Vectorworks trial is free, easy, and gives you the chance to do some research before committing to a license. Use this time to get a feel for Fundamentals’ [user interface](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/palettes-workspaces-and-ui-in-vectorworks.html), as well as its precision drawing, modeling, rendering, and documentation capabilities.

### Step 2 | Take Advantage of Free Learning Resources

As you explore Vectorworks during your trial period, take the time to check out some free learning resources on [Vectorworks University](http://university.vectorworks.net/) (our learning management system), the [Planet Vectorworks blog](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/index.html), or our [monthly webinars series](https://www.vectorworks.net/events).

We offer you a mix of general and industry-specific content. So, depending on your industry, you can filter content so it’s best tailored to you and your work.

### Step 3 | Purchase Your Preferred License

After your trial, you can choose between a monthly or a yearly subscription.

#### **Option 1: Monthly Subscription**

A monthly subscription allows you to pay for only what you need when you need it.

#### **Option 2: Yearly Subscription**

This option means you can maintain access to Vectorworks year-round at a discount compared to paying monthly.

### Step 4 | Training Opportunities

There’s a variety of ways to get help with Vectorworks!

First, check out the [Community Forum](http://forum.vectorworks.net/) to engage with like-minded designers and Vectorworks staff. Even if you don’t feel like posting yourself, you might find that your question has been answered already.

[Vectorworks University](http://university.vectorworks.net/) is a great place to familiarize yourself with operations and workflows.

If you’re looking for more specific training, the customer success team at Vectorworks is filled with product specialists who are experts at using Vectorworks software. You can take classes online, schedule sessions for your entire firm, or even work one-on-one with a member of the training team.

### Step 5 | Take on a Pilot Project

As you familiarize yourself with using Vectorworks, try using the software on a pilot project. A pilot project is a real project with real stakes.

Here are some recommendations for choosing a pilot project:

1. One with a non-compressed timeline.
2. One with a more straightforward design solution.
3. One that's representative of the kind of work you normally do.

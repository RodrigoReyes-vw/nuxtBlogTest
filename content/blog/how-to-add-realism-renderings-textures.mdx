# Stunning, Realistic Renderings Using Textures in Vectorworks

You’re full of limitless design ideas.

But sometimes, a client may have a hard time understanding your vision for their interior space. [This is why communicating your design intent is so important](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/communicate-inspiration-interiors-vectorworks.html)!

This post will show you how textures can enhance your renderings or presentations — leaving a positive impression on your clients. Read on and you’ll learn the following:

* Why you should use textures in Vectorworks
* Texture options available to you in Vectorworks
* Useful features when using the texture resource in Vectorworks

## Why Use Textures in Your Vectorworks Design?

Adding textures to your renderings and presentations is an essential step in creating photorealistic renderings and other presentation drawings. Not only do textures show your client how well thought-out your design is, but they also help you explore finishes and other big-picture aspects of your interior project.

The use of textures in [Vectorworks Architect](https://www.vectorworks.net/architect) is also a powerful way for you to add realism to your renderings. When a client sees a texture-filled visualization that you create, they’re able to picture themselves in the space.

Ultimately, the use of textures in your interior visualizations will help you win more work!

## What Texture Options Do You Have in Vectorworks?

Below are just a few options you have to access or create textures in Vectorworks. Each option has its own specific advantages — giving you the freedom to create however you’d like!

### Default Texture Library

Countless textures can be found under “Renderworks Textures” in the Vectorworks Default Libraries. You can also find pre-defined texture shaders by simply searching “textures” in your search bar.

### Mosa Textures in Vectorworks

Mosa, [a Vectorworks partner](https://www.vectorworks.net/community/partner-network/find-partner/royal-mosa), is a tiled pattern creator within Vectorworks that also includes textures.

### Glow Textures in Vectorworks

When you’re creating beautiful renderings and presentations with textures, also remember that textures can be used as a light source. This will further boost the realism of your design.

One specific way you can do this is with glow textures, which are in the Reflection option in the Texture Editor. You can use these Renderworks textures to create neon lights, TV screens, building signage, and much more!

Watch the video below to see more.

### Mtextur Textures in Vectorworks

[Mtextur](https://www.vectorworks.net/community/partner-network/find-partner/mtextur), another Vectorworks partner, lets you add real-world materials and products to your rendering. When using these textures, the exact materials you’re using in a rendering can appear in the final product, thanks to a hyperlink in the Resource Manager that takes you to additional information on the material and how to source it.

You can use search criteria like material group, color, classification, manufacturer, and/or delivery zone when trying to determine what material you’ll specify for your design.

### Custom Textures in Vectorworks

If none of the above texturing options aren't quite what you want, don’t worry. You also have the freedom to create your own textures using the Texture Editor.

Watch the video below to learn about creating custom textures.

### Cinema 4D Texture Import

If you love the creativity and specificity that comes with custom textures in Vectorworks, you’ll likely also be interested in the Cinema 4D Texture Import command. With this feature, you’re able to use texture shaders created in Cinema 4D and easily access them through a simple file import.

Check out this quick video to see how the Cinema 4D Texture Import command can help you increase the size and quality of your texture libraries.

## Other Useful Features When Using Textures in Vectorworks 

You now know what textures are at your disposal in Vectorworks, so the next step is learning what features will allow you to better control the creation, modification, and implementation of textures. 

The following features will have you well on your way to creating stunning renderings.

### Shaders

Within a given texture, there are four “shaders” that allow you to tweak certain aspects of a texture. These shaders give you a heightened level of control over each texture you use in a design.

#### The four shaders are:

1. Reflectivity
2. Color
3. Bump
4. Transparency

You can modify within the Texture Editor by going to the Resource Manager, right-clicking on a specific texture, and accessing the context menu.

### Per-Face Texture Mapping

[Per-face Texture Mapping](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/per-face-texturing-mapping-feature-2022.html) provides you with design flexibility when applying textures to modeled objects.

With the Texture tool, you’re able to customize an object on a face-by-face basis. You also have the ability to adjust the scale and rotation of your textures for each face of an object. Click the link below to learn more about Per-face Texture Mapping.

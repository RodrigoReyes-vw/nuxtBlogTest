The Museum of Contemporary Arts in Bonn, by Benno Schmitz, a Beuth Hochschule für Technik Berlin student, won the 2015 grand prize. Schmitz’s advice: “Stop dreaming and just do it!

The way you communicate your work can be just as important as the work itself. Take some advice from Diego Bermudez, grand prize winner of the 2014 scholarship for his project, Circasia: Engaging the Creeks:

“The most important thing I conveyed is the impact my project would have on the community in Circasia,” Bermudez said. “Precisely detailing how my project could improve the ecology of the creeks and the quality of life for the townspeople is what I think gave my submission an edge.”![Circasia-Public-Space-1](https://blog.vectorworks.net/hs-fs/hubfs/190225_Dont%20Miss%20Your%20Chance%20/Circasia-Public-Space-1.png?width=536&name=Circasia-Public-Space-1.png)

In short, write about why your project _matters_. Show that your work can incite positive change.

Brush off and repurpose those old designs or create something entirely new. Even the most brilliant designs start with just an idea — so why not submit yours?

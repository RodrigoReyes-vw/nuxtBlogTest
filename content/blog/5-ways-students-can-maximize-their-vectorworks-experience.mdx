###### Vectorworks Certifications

Now that more companies are opening up in-person and veteran employers looking for new hires, it’s imperative to find resources and opportunities to help boost your resume to propel yourself into future employment. The [Vectorworks certifications](https://university.vectorworks.net/local/certifications/info.php) provide validation of your skills for future advancement of your career and the ability to stand out. 

170+ courses of content will aid your resume, provide a deeper understanding of the technological design field, expand your knowledge with a universal skillset, and set the groundwork for your future.

While you are not limited to a certain field, the transition from the training info to the actual software is a smooth transition that students can get the hang of rather quickly. 

The program provides a truly unique, user-oriented learning experience without the feeling of being forced into a certain category or need to purchase further help. Students have the ability to fine-tune workflows and get a deeper understanding of the software.

###### Building a Vectorworks Account 

Signing up for your own [Vectorworks account](https://sso.vectorworks.net/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Funiversity.vectorworks.net%2Flogin%2Findex.php&errorcode=4) is an easy step and you will benefit from the many learning opportunities, however, creating an account can be a valuable decision. With an account, Vectorworks serves as a permanent home for building a transcript of all the completed elements of the program. 

Not only is it helpful for organization and building knowledge, but the transcript generated upon creating an account can be relayed or shared with employers to demonstrate the completion of different certifications, tutorials, webinars, and many other pieces of content. 

Connecting back to the importance of standing out, a Vectorworks account can be maintained throughout your college experience and eventually amplify yourself as a candidate.

Beginner courses and certifications can be stressful for students, but the various learning experiences are framed to minimize headaches and frustrations through a step-by-step learning experience for all types of students. 

With the established introductory information presented, getting started with the software and understanding the main takeaways through quick info allows for a more successful [learning experience](https://university.vectorworks.net/).

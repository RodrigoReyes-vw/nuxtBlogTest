The best designs don't just pique your curiosity. They provide an environment that inspires those who inhabit that space. 

In May 2020, we showcased these contemporary park structures designed by Norbert Roztocki, founder of [moveART](http://moveart.swiss/en/vision/). Roztocki showcased his use of the [Marionette](https://www.vectorworks.net/training/marionette?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=081920madewithvectorworks) tool used to algorithmically repeat parts of his design to create uniformity. The time he saved using [Marionette](/what-is-marionette-a-look-at-vectorworks-algorithmic-modeling-tool?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=081920madewithvectorworks) helped keep his designs consistent and produce his designs quickly.

Designers everywhere aren’t just designing new homes — they’re reimagining entire lifestyles to create functional, inspiring residences. [Studio Upwall Architects](http://www.studioupwall.com/) in Washington, D.C. used [Vectorworks](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fcontent=081920madewithvectorworks) to dream up this stunning apartment complex proposal for a vacant site. Being part of the #MadeWithVectorworks campaign connects you to an innovative, global design community.

Portuguese firm [Spaceworkers](https://www.spaceworkers.pt/en/) dreamed up The Design Factory and Innovation in Paredes, Portugal. The building facilitates creativity for its community with its open design and uniquely shaped structures, which offer visitors and designers different perspectives. The inclusion of trees and asymmetrical branch-like structures infuses a sense of nature in an otherwise minimalist design. The complex and intricate nature of this project excited us so much that we simply had to include them in [MODUS News](https://www.modusnews.com/europe/fab-lab).

Architects are using Vectorworks to put a contemporary spin on long-standing institutions. Munich-based firm [Meck Architekten](https://www.meck-architekten.de/) reimagined the modern church with its design of the Church of Seliger Pater Rupert Mayer. The towering white crown roof’s combination of sharp lines and basket-like texture weaves together the best of contemporary and traditional architecture. The overall design provides a place where churchgoers are able to convene to celebrate their traditions within a modern context.

# Marionette Monday: New Symbols That Will Fold and Lift

To help you get through your case of the Mondays, here are some new Marionette objects specifically created in response to user comments on the [Vectorworks Forum](https://forum.vectorworks.net/?%20utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=marrionettemon022618).

“We plan to release new Marionette content every six to eight weeks,” said Sarah Barrett, architect product specialist at Vectorworks, Inc. “This content is based on user wishes and will live in the Forum for now as we continue to collect feedback.”

Let’s take a look at these recent releases, and how they can enhance your drawings.

## Object 1: NanaWall Door

Users can set the walls to be any length, as well as set the width and height of the panel sides.

Users can place this symbol in their drawings and set the height via a slider in [the Object Info palette](http://app-help.vectorworks.net/2018/eng/VW2018%5FGuide/Objects%5Fedit1/The%5FObject%5FInfo%5FPalette%5FData%5FTab.htm?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=intext&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=marrionettemon022618).
